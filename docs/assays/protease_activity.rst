Protease activity assay
=======================

Protease activity assay is to quantify the activity of the purified protease. This step is required before we do protease assay with our compounds.  

Prepare stock solutions and buffers before we actually start the procedure, preferably one day before the experiment day. Usually the buffers and stock solutions can be stored in 4 C for future use. 

**Requires** 

* Buffer
* Purified protease 

**Procedure**

#. Purified protease is usually stored in -80 C. Thaw it before use.
