Cryopreservation
================

This protocol in our lab uses 500 uL of cell suspension for each cryopreservation tube. Depending on the final volume of your cell suspension, you can estimate how many tubes you can cryo. For example, if the final volume of cell suspension is 3 mL, then you can cryo up to 6 tubes. 

**Requires**

* DMSO
* Cryopreservation tube
* :ref:`Complete DMEM <10 dmem>`

**Procedure**

#. Trypsinise the cells from culture flask. Refer to :ref:`trypsinise <My target>`.
#. In each cryopreservation tube, prepare the freezing media:

   * 450 uL complete DMEM
   * 50 uL DMSO

    Freezing media was prepare before adding to cells because concentrated DMSO is toxic to cells, so we diluted the concentrated DMSO with complete DMEM.  

#. Insert 500 uL of cell suspension into cryopreservation tube. 
#. Place cryopreservation tube in Mr. Frosty. 
#. Store in -80 :math:`^{\circ} C` overnight.
#. Transfer cryopreservation tube from -80 :math:`^{\circ} C` to liquid nitrogen tank. 

*Note:* Cells can be stored for short term in -80 :math:`^{\circ} C`, but for long term storage, it is better to store in gas phase of liquid nitrogen.*
