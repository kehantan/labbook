Antiviral assay
===============

**Objective:** To test antiviral properties of a compound. 

The reference for antiviral protocol can be found in articles published by :cite:t:`lani2016antiviral,florez2022vitro`. 

We should do a regular plaque assay to quantify the virus titer of the virus stock before we do antiviral assay, because we need to fix the multiplicity of infection (MOI) to a number. For example, 

* MOI = 1, 1 virus particle for each cell
* MOI = 2, 2 virus particle for each cell
* MOI = 0.5, 1 virus particle for every 2 cells, etc. 

Before starting antiviral assay, we should have several information ready.

#. Virus titer of the virus stock, in pfu/ml

    This information can be obtain from a regular plaque assay. This is why we need to do a regular plaque assay before doing antiviral assay. 

#. MOI you wanted to use

    Refer to published articles for the MOI we wanted to use for our experiments.   

#. Concentration of compound we wanted to test

    This requires some trial and error. For pure synthesised organic compounds I usually start with smaller value like 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ug/mL. The concentration could be adjusted to higer value depends on the type of compounds to be tested, ie: peptides, plant extracts, etc. 


**Planning**

We can have some planning on which well we want to use for what (i.e.: negative control, virus control, different concentrations). We can plan this before or after we seed the well plates with cells and we can make the arrangement however we like. 

Imagine a 12 well plate 

(A1) (A2) (A3) (A4)

(B1) (B2) (B3) (B4)

(C1) (C2) (C3) (C4)

I would typically do 

* A1 = Negative control (Cells without virus infection)
* B1-C1 = Virus control (Cells with virus infection, but not treated with compound)
* A2-C2 = Compound X concentration 1 (Cells with virus infection and treated with compound)
* A3-C3 = Compound X concentration 2 (Cells with virus infection and treated with compound)
* A4-C4 = Compound X concentration 3 (Cells with virus infection and treated with compound)

This is merely a suggestion, you can tailor the arrangement however you like according to the need of your experiments, but always remember to include negative control and virus control wells. 


Cell seeding
------------

For antiviral assay, our cells should be at 70% confluency at the day of infection and treatment. 

* For 6 well plate, we can seed 450,000 cells for next day infection and treatment. 
* For 12 well plate, we can seed 150,000 cells for next day infection and treatment. 


Infection and treatment
-----------------------

Before the actual infection and treatment, we should prepare 2 things: 

#. Different concentrations of the compound we wanted to test. 

    We would dilute the compounds we wanted to test to the desired concentrations with 2% DMEM. The final volume of the compound we prepare should be 1500 uL. This volume was intended to be used with 6 well plate, we can be reduce the volume accordingly if we are using well plates of other sizes.

#. Dilution of virus stock to the concentration we wanted to work with. 

    We need to know the pfu/mL of the virus stock and determine the MOI we wanted to use in order for this to work. We usually to 10 times dilution with 2% DMEM to the diluted concentration of virus stock we wanted to work with. 

**Procedure**

#. Remove existing media from well plate. 
#. Wash cells with PBS. 
#. Add correct amount of diluted virus stock to designated wells. 
#. Add corerct amount of diluted compound into designated wells.
#. Incubate. 37C, 1 hr. Tilt well plate every 20 mins. 
#. Wash cells with PBS. 
#. Add the remaining amount of compound-containing media into the disignated wells. 
#. Incubate. 37C, 48 hr. 

Harvest
-------

Observe the well plate every 24 hrs for formation of CPE. Usually the media in the well plates can be harvested after 48 hours or when there are high number of CPE. 

Distribute the media in each well into multiple microcentrifuge tube so we can do multiple plaque assays later on. 

**Procedure**

#. Label the microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Aliquot the exist media in the well plates into different microcentrifuge tube.
#. Snap freeze the microcentrifuge tube in liguid nitrogen. 
#. Store at -80 C. 


Plaque assay
------------

Do a regular :ref:`plaque assay <plaque assay>` with media harvested from each well in the antiviral assay. Then quantify by manually counting the number of plques.
