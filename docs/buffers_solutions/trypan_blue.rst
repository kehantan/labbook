Trypan blue
===========

* Trypan blue comes as a stock solution in a bottle.
* Just aliquote into a smaller vial and it is ready to be used. 
* Because we usually do not use large amount of trypan blue, it should be sufficient to aliquote it into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
* Trypan blue can be stored at bench for future use. 
* It is not necessarily to aliquote the trypan blue in the biosafety cabinet.
