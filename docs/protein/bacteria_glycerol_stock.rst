Bacteria glycerol stock
=======================

**Objective:** To make bacteria glycerol stock 

* Bacteria glycerol stock is for long term storage 
* Schematics for making bacteria glycerol stock can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17MrwEkPY6BbYUZrCteCmLGkgHx3DN52Zq91Yix2CnXw/edit?usp=sharing>`_

**Requires**

* Overnight culture of transformed *E.coli* culture
* Inoculating loop
* Bunsen burner 
* Lighter/Matchsticks
* Microcentrifuge tube/Eppendorf tube (1.5 mL)
* 50% glycerol solution
* Rack

**Procedure**

#. Set up bench for bacteria work. 
#. Take overnight transformed *E.coli* culture from incubator. 
#. Add 500 uL of 50% glycerol into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Take a loopful of bacteria colonies with an inoculating loop. 
#. Add the bacteria colonies into the glycerol. Make sure the colonies resuspend completely in the glycerol, vortex if necessary.  
#. Label the tubes. 
#. Store the bacteria glycerol stock in -80 C.
