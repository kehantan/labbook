PMSF
====

**Objective:** To prepare stock PMSF solution for protein purification. 

* Can be prepared on bench.
* PMSF is not soluble in water, so have to use isopropyl alcohol. Other solvent like DMSO can also be used. 
* PMSF is sensitive and can degrade easily in water, prepare freshly before use.  
* Concentration = 10 mM, Volume = 5 mL 
* PMSF MW = 174.19 g/mol

**Materials**

* Centrifuge tube
* Isopropyl alcohol
* PMSF powder
* Syringe
* 0.22 um syringe filter
* Spatula 

**Procedure**

#. Mix well, vortex if necessary. 
#. Filter with 0.22 um syringe filter.
