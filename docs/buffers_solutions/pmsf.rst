**Objective:** To prepare stock PMSF solution for protein purification. 

* PMSF 30 mM, final volume 2 mL. 
* This stock solution can be prepared on bench.
* PMSF is not soluble in water, so have to use isopropyl alcohol. Other solvent like DMSO can also be used. 
* PMSF is sensitive and can degrade easily in water, prepare freshly before use.  
* PMSF MW = 174.19 g/mol

**Requires**

* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Isopropyl alcohol
* PMSF powder
* Syringe
* 0.22 um syringe filter
