MTT working solution
====================

**Objective:** To prepare MTT working solution from MTT powder. 

* MTT comes in powder form. 
* Concentration of MTT we use in this lab is 5 mg/mL
* MTT solution can be prepared on bench. 
* We usually prepare 10 mL of MTT working solution in 15 mL centrifuge tube and store in freezer (-20 C).
* MTT solution is sensitive to light. Wrap the prepared solution in aluminium foil before storing in freezer. 
* Schematics for preparing MTT solution can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IIiZSPVcTfXI2qt4P9eORFXnCTqsc18I3t5ufM8Zi7M/edit?usp=sharing>`_.

**Requires**

* MTT powder 

    MTT powder can be found in fridge (4 C)

* Distilled water or PBS
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Syringe
* Syringe filter (0.22 um)
* Aluminium foil

**Procedure**

#. Weight 0.05 g (50 mg) of MTT powder and transfer into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Add 10 mL of distilled water in to the centrifuge tube.

    * We can use either distilled water or PBS to dissolve MTT powder. 

#. Vortex the solution until MTT is completely dissolve. 

    * Dissolve as much MTT powder as possible. Usually the powder would not dissolve completely, leaving behind some small chunks of solids. This is ok, we will filter it out in the next step.
    * Or you can use a sonicator to break all the small clumps. 

#. Filter with syringe filter. 
#. Wrap the centrifuge tube with aluminium foil. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube. 

    * Label example: :code:`MTT, 5 mg/mL, name initials, date prepared`

#. Store MTT working solution in frezer (-20 C).
