Complete DMEM 
==============

* Complete DMEM with 10% FBS, final volume 50 mL.
* Prepare complete DMEM in the biosafety cabinet under sterile environment to avoid contamination.

**Materials**

* FBS
* Pen-Strep
* :ref:`DMEM <dmem>`
* Centrifuge tube (50 mL)
* Sodium pyruvate *(if required)*
* Micropipette and tips
* Waste beaker 
* Serological pipette 
* Pipette gun 

**Procedure**

#. Into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, add:

   +-----------+---------+---------+
   |           | 10%     | 2%      |
   +-----------+---------+---------+
   | DMEM      | 44.5 mL | 48.5 mL |
   +-----------+---------+---------+
   | FBS       |    5 mL | 1 mL    |
   +-----------+---------+---------+
   | Pen-Strep |  0.5 mL | 0.5 mL  |
   +-----------+---------+---------+

   * If DMEM does not come with sodium pyruvate added, reduce 0.5 mL of DMEM and add 0.5 mL of sodium pyruvate instead. 

#. Mix well. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube. 

   * Label example: :code:`Complete DMEM, name initials, date prepared`

#. Seal with parafilm and store in 4 C.

**Note**

* Final concentration for sodium pyruvate is 1 mM.
* The volume of sodium pyruvate to add into complete DMEM depends on the concentration of the sodium pyruvate stock solution. Adjust the volume of DMEM to compensate the volume changes in sodium pyruvate.
* Recipe can be modified according to different needs.

DMEM (2%)
=========

* DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, final volume 50 mL.  
* Prepare 2% DMEM in biosafety cabinet. 
* Schematics for preparing 2% DMEM can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XIx-L6bWyaaJ7a30QiGjVbNT-d0Omj4--MuUFlvaePM/edit?usp=sharing>`_. 

**Materials**

* FBS
* Pen-Strep
* :ref:`DMEM <dmem>`
* Centrifuge tube (50 mL)
* Sodium pyruvate (if required)
* Micropipette and tips (1000 uL)
* Waste beaker
* Serological pipette 
* Pipette gun

**Procedures**

#. Into 50 mL centrifuge tube, add:

   +-----------+---------+
   | DMEM      | 48.5 mL |
   +-----------+---------+
   | FBS       |    1 mL |
   +-----------+---------+
   | Pen-Strep |  0.5 mL |
   +-----------+---------+

    * If DMEM does not have sodium pyrubate added, reduce 0.5 mL of DMEM and add 0.5 mL of sodium pyruvate. 

#. Mix well. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube.

   * Label example: :code:`2% DMEM, name initials, date prepared`

#. Seal with parafilm and store in 4 C.
