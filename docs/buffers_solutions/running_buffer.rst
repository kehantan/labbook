Running buffer
==============

**Objective:** To prepare running buffer for SDS-PAGE.

* This protocol prepares running buffer in 1x concentration, another way is to prepare 10x and dilute to 1x before use.
* Volume = 1 L 
* pH 8.3 (pH of final solution should be around 8.3, no adjustment required)

*Recipe*

**Materials**

* Tris base powder
* Glycine powder 
* SDS powder 
* Distilled water 
* Bottle (1 L)
* Weighing balance 
* Weighing boat

**Procedure**

#. Measure the following into a 1 L empty bottle. 

    * Tris base, 3.028 g 
    * Glycine, 14.2633 g 
    * SDS, 1 g

#. Add 500 to 700 mL of distilled water into the empty bottle.
