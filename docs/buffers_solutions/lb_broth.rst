Prepare LB broth
================

* To prepare LB broth, follow the instructions on the LB broth bottle.
* This procedure can be carry out on lab bench.  
* Schemactics for preparing LB broth can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qZ7I4THBtuevUjca72BpT-3oJ3MLoqcnKhC-mZUu5pg/edit?usp=sharing>`_

**Requires**

* Erlenmeyer flask (2 L)
* Bottle (100 mL, autoclaved) 
* Weighting balance
* Weighting boat
* Spatula 
* LB broth powder 
* Distilled water 
* Measuring cylinder (1 L)
* :ref:`Kanamycin (30 mg/mL) <kanamycin>`

**Procedure**

#. In a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask, dissolve 12.5 g of LB powder in 500 mL distilled water. Cover the mouth of the flask with aluminium foil. 
#. Autoclave. 120 C, 15 mins. 
#. Wait until the LB broth cools down, then add 500 uL of Kanamycin stock solution into LB broth.
#. Take around 50 mL of LB broth and store in a clean bottle.

    * To be used as a blank for OD measuring in protein expression. 

#. Cover the mouth of the flask with aluminium foil and store on bench. 

**Note:** 

* For the ease of work, aside from preparing LB broth for large scale culture, prepare another smaller volume of LB broth in a 500 mL bottle used for various purpose such as small scale culture and as a blank for measuring the OD of the cultured bacteria. 
* For protein expression, prepare the LB broth 1 or 2 days before the actual expression work. Avoid preparing the broth too early to prevent contamination.
