Protein expression
==================

**Objective:** To culture bacteria that will express the target recombinant protein.  

**Workflow**

#. Agar plate culture
#. Small scale culture 
#. Large scale culture

Agar plate culture
------------------

**Materials** 

* :ref:`LB agar plate <lb-agar-plate>`(Need to prepare at least 1 day before)
* Transformed bacteria glycerol stock (*E.coli*, BL21 strain)
* Inoculating loop 
* Lighter
* Bunsen burner

**Procedure**

#. Sterilise inoculating loop by passing the loop 2-3 times through the bunsen burner flame. 
#. Take a loop full of the *E.coli* glycerol stock and streak on agar plate. 
#. Incubate. 24 hrs, 37 C.   

Small scale culture
-------------------

**Materials**

* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Transformed *E. coli* cultured on agar plate 
* Plastic inoculation loop
* Bunsen burner
* Lighter 
* :ref:`Small volume LB broth <lb broth small>` (Need to prepare at least 1 day before)

**Procedure** 
 
#. Prepare two 15 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Add 10 mL of LB broth into each 15 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Pick multiple *E. coli* single colony from agar plate and mix with LB broth in the 15 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Shake the centrifuge tube in incubator shaker. 24 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm.

Large scale culture
-------------------

**Materials**

* Spectrophotometer
* :ref:`LB broth in 2 L Erlenmeyer flask <lb broth large>` (Need to prepare at least 1 day before)
* 2 L orbital shaker
* :ref:`IPTG stock solution (250 mM)<iptg>`
* Refrigerated centrifuge 
* PBS 
* Centrifuge tube (50 mL)
* Micropipette (1000 uL)
* Micropipette tip (1000 uL)

**Procedure**

#. Add the small scale culture from 15 mL centrifuge tube culture into the 500 mL LB broth in the 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. 
#. Shake. 1 to 3 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm. 
#. Check OD at 600 nm every 1 hour, target OD ~0.5-0.6. 

    * Need to extend the shaking time if target OD is not reached.

#. When OD is around 0.5 - 0.6, add 1 mL of IPTG stock solution (250 mM) to the LB broth culture.

    * IPTG final concentration in LB broth = 0.5 mM

#. Shake. 2 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm.
#. Transfer culture from flask into multiple 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 4000 rpm, 4 C, 10 mins. 

    * 4 C is preferrable, if not, room temp is fine. 

#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Resuspend pellet in 2000 uL PBS.  

    * Prepare another PBS for bacteria work. Seperate bacteria work PBS with cell culture PBS to prevent contamination. 

#. Combine all resusupended pellet into two 50 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Top up PBS to 50 mL in each tube.  
#. Centrifuge. 3000 rpm, 4C, 10 mins.  
#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube.
#. Store pellet at -80 C.

    * Bacterial pellet can be stored in -80 C for months without problem.
