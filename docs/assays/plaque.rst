Plaque assay
============

Plaque assay to quantify the virus titer in a sample. I seperate this protocol into different sections, each section indicates 1 day.


Section 1 - Cell seeding
------------------------

* Cells should be at least 90% confluency at the time of infection.
* Amount of cells harvested from a T75 flask with 80% confluency should be sufficient to seed at least 2 6 well plate with 600,000 cells in each well for next day virus infection.   
* Number of cells to seed depends on which day you want to do infection 

    * Seed 6 well plate with 600,000 cells per well for next day infection 
    * Seed 400,000 cells per well for infection after 2 days 


Requires

* Complete DMEM
* 6 well plate


**Procedure**

#. Trypsinise the cells in culture flask. 
 
    Refer to :ref:`trypsinise <My target>` for procedure.

#. Check if there are enough cells for 6 well plate. Calculate the required amount of cell suspension to aspirate into each well.
#. Dispense 1.5 mL of complete DMEM in each well of the 6 well plate. 
#. Dispense required amount of cell suspension into each well. 
#. Tilt the 6 well plate to distribute the cells evenly. 
#. Incubate for 24 hrs or longer depending on the number of cells you seed.


Section 2 - Infection
---------------------

After 24 hrs incubation, infect cells with virus. 

*Note: For steps involving virus, avoid using seropipette. As our lab policy requires virus waste to be handled seperately, using seropipette to handle virus can make disposal of the serological pipette difficult. It is easier to dispose pipette tips than the serological pipette.*


Requires

* 2% DMEM 
* Microcentrifuge tube


**Dilution of virus**

#. Thaw virus stock in 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C water bath. 
#. Do a serial dilution of the stock virus from microcentrifuge tube in a 10 fold dilution factor with 2% DMEM. 

    Can start from 1 to 5 times dilution factor.   


**Infection**

#. Label each well.

    Negative control, 1x dilution, 2x dilution, etc.

#. Remove media with serological pipette. 

    Aspirate media from wall of the well to prevent scratching on the cell layer

#. Wash with PBS.

    There are no fix amount use, just need to cover the cell layer. I usually use 300 uL. 
    
    Dispense from the wall of each well to prevent detaching the cell layer due to pressure from micropipette. 

#. Add 300 uL of 2% DMEM in negative control well.
#. Add 300 uL of diluted virus into corresponding well. 

    Remember to vortex the mircocentrifuge tube to mix the virus before adding the virus to the well. 

#. Incubate the 6 well plate at 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C for 1 hour. Tilt the plate every 20 mins. 
#. After 1 hour, overlay the infected cell layer with agarose. 


**Agarose overlay**

#. Prepare agarose by heating the solidified agarose in a microwave oven. 
  
    Heat until the agarose melts and boils, but do not let agarose bubble for too long, as it will evaporate the water content in the agarose. Let the agarose bubbling for 1 or 2 seconds should be sufficient. 

#. In a 15 ml centrifuge tube, add 9 ml of 2% DMEM and 1 ml of agarose. 

    Mix the agarose and 2% DMEM by repeating pipette. 

#. Remove the media with diluted virus from 6 well plate. 
#. Wash the cells 2 times with PBS.
#. Dispense 1.5 mL of agarose mixture into each well. 
#. Leave the 6 well plate in room temperature for 10 to 15 mins.
#. Agarose should hardens after around 10 mins. 

    You can slightly tilt the plate to check if the agarose solidifies. 

    Do not tilt the plate at an overly steep angle as the agarose will torn apart upon its own weight. 

#. Transfer the 6 well plate into incubator. 

It usually takes 24 hrs for the CPE to form, and another 24 hrs for the cell infected with virus to die. So usually after 48 hrs of incubation, we can fix and stain the plaque. 


Section 3 - Fix and stain 
-------------------------
We use crystal violet to stain the cells that are attached to the 6 well plate. The dead cells would detached from the 6 well plate and get washed away, leaving behind a clear spot after staining. 


Requires

* Paraformaldehyde (PFA), 3.7%
* Crystal violet


#. Fix the cells with 3.7% PFA for 1 hr.
    
    There are no fix volume, just need to cover the cell layer. 300 uL should be enough. 

    Dispense from the wall of each well. It is normal for the agarose to torn apart or disintegrate once the PFA was applied 

#. Remove PFA after 1 hr. 
#. Rinse the plate in a bucket of water for a few times to wash away the agarose. 
#. Decant excess water from 6 well plate by slightly tapping the plate facing down against a paper towel. 
#. Stain the wells with crystal violet for 2 to 3 mins. 

    No fix volume required, just need to cover the cell layer. 300 uL should be enough. 

    Dispense from the wall of each well. 

#. Tilt the plate to make sure crystal violet covers the whole area in a well. 
#. Remove the crystal violet. 
#. Rinse the plate in a bucket of water for a few times to wash away excess crystal violet. 
#. Decant excess water from 6 well plate by slightly tapping the plate facing down against a paper towel. 
#. Leave the plate on bench to air dry. 


This protocol shows how to work with 6 well plate. If you want to do plaque assay in a 12 well plate, there are slight changes need to be made. 

* Cell seeding - 300,000 cells per well for next day infection 
* Use 1 mL of media instead of 1.5 mL
