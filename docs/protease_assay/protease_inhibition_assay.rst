Protease inhibition assay
=========================

**Objective:** To check the inhibition activity of a compound against the target protease. 

* Reference for protease assay protocol: :cite:p:`ihssen_fluorogenic_2021`. 
* There are several standard curve that need to be plotted before we carry out protease assay with the compounds that we wanted to test.  

    * **Protease activity curve** From protease activity assay, we can find out the Km value of protease activity curve, which dictates how much protease to use for protease inhibition assay 

    * **Substrate optimisation curve** From substrate optimisation assay, we can findout the Km value of substrate optimisation curve, which dictates how much substrate we should use for protease inhibition assay.  

**Requires**

* Stock Tris-HCl buffer (1M, pH 8.5)
* Substrate (MCA)
* DMSO 
* Microcentrifuge tube
* 384 black well plate
* Micropipette and tips (1000 uL, 100 uL, 10 uL) 

**Procedure**

**Prepare working buffer**

* Prepare working buffer from stock Tris-HCl buffer. Final concentration of working buffer, 200 mM, pH 8.5.   

#. Add 800 uL of distilled water into a microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Add 200 uL of stock Tris-HCl buffer into the microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Mix well and set a side for later use. 

**Prepare substrate (MCA)**

* Substrate comes in powder form, kept in a dark coloured vial.
* This step can be skipped if the substrate was prepared beforehand.

#. Add specified amount of DMSO into the substrate vial as per instruction on the vial's information sheet. 
#. Aliquote the dissolved substrate into different PCR tube and store in -20 C. This is to minimise freeze-thaw cycle of the vial. 

**Prepare working compound**

* Prepare working compound serial diluted to various concentration from compound stock solution, by using DMSO.
* Stock compound concentration = 20 mg/mL
* First concentration of serial dilution = 500 ug/mL

#. Prepare 8 microcentrifuge tube.
#. Add 10 uL of DMSO into each microcentrifuge tube.
#. Add 10 uL of stock compound into the first microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by pipette repeatedly.
#. Transfer 10 uL of compound from first microcentrifuge tube to second microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by pipette repeatedly. 
#. Repeat the process up to the last tube. 

*

#. Prepare a 384 black well plate. Label the wells to be used correctly on the lid. 
#. Thaw protease from -80 C. 
#. Add correct amount of buffer into each well. 
#. Add correct amount of protease into each well. 
#. Add 2 uL of diluted compound into wells assigned for different concentrations. 
#. Incubate. 30 mins, 37 C. 
#. Thaw substrate from -20 C. 
#. Retrieve well plate from incubator. 
#. Add 1.6 uL of substrate into each well.
#. Incubate. 120 mins, 37 C.  
#. Read plate at 350 nm excitation and 440 nm emission. 

The final volume of liquid in each well should be 100 uL. You can adjust to 200 uL since the well can fit, but beware that you will also need to increase the amount of protease (which is very precious), amount of compound, amount of substrate, which might not be very sufficient for 200 uL. 

If I wanted to test the compound at 1,600, 800, 400, and 200 ug/mL, I will prepare different tube by diluting stock solution of the compound to concentration of 16,000, 8,000, 4,000, and 2,000 ug/mL with DMSO. This is so that when I add 10 uL of the 1,600 ug/mL, it will be diluted by 10 times by the protease, buffer, and substrate, which makes the final volume of the compound to become 1,600 ug/mL. This is same with substrate. This is to make the volume consistant, where only 10 uL of compound and 10 uL of substrate will be added in each experiment.   

**Analysis**

:math:`\text{Inhibition (%)} = \frac{\text{NT}-\text{T}}{\text{NT}}\times 100%`

* NT = Non-treated
* T = Treated
