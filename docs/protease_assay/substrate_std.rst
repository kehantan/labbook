Substrate standard
==================

**Objective:** To plot a standard curve for substrate used in protease assay. 

**Requires**

* Stock buffer solution (1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)
* Substrate (MCA)

**Prepare buffer** 

* From stock buffer, prepare 200 mM Tris-HCl. 

**Procedure**

#. Do 1/2 fold serial dilution of stock substrate using working buffer solution in a black 96 well plate. 
#. Read plate at 350 nm for excitation and 440 nm for emission. 
#. Plot the graph using graphpad prism.
