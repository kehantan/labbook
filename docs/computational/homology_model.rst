Homology modelling
==================
Homology modelling with SWISS-MODEL to fix missing amino acid residues on protein receptor for molecular docking or molecular dynamics simulation works. 

`SWISS-MODEL <https://swissmodel.expasy.org/>`_

To validate the homology model, I use `SAVES <https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/>`_
