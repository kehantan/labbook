Protease inhibition assay
=========================

**Objective:** To check the inhibition activity of a compound against the target protease. 

* Reference for protease assay protocol: :cite:p:`ihssen_fluorogenic_2021`. 
* There are several standard curve that need to be plotted before we carry out protease assay with the compounds that we wanted to test.  

    * **Protease activity curve** From protease activity assay, we can find out the Km value of protease activity curve, which dictates how much protease to use for protease inhibition assay 

    * **Substrate optimisation curve** From substrate optimisation assay, we can findout the Km value of substrate optimisation curve, which dictates how much substrate we should use for protease inhibition assay.  

**Requires**

* Stock Tris-HCl buffer (1M, pH 8.5)
* MCA substrate stock solution (10 mM)
* DMSO 
* Microcentrifuge tube
* 384 black well plate
* Micropipette and tips (1000 uL, 100 uL, 10 uL) 

**Procedure**

*Prepare working buffer*

To prepare 200 mM from 1 M of Tris-HCl:

#. Add 200 uL of 1M Tris-HCl into 800 uL of distilled water. 
#. Mix well. Vortex if necessary. 

*Prepare working compound*

* Prepare working compound serial diluted to various concentration from compound stock solution, by using DMSO.
* Stock compound concentration = 20 mg/mL
* First concentration of serial dilution = 500 ug/mL

#. Prepare 8 microcentrifuge tube.
#. Add 10 uL of DMSO into each microcentrifuge tube.
#. Add 10 uL of stock compound into the first microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by pipette repeatedly.
#. Transfer 10 uL of compound from first microcentrifuge tube to second microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by pipette repeatedly. 
#. Repeat the process up to the last tube. 

*Inhition assay*

#. Label the wells to be used correctly on the lid of a 384 well black plate. 
#. Thaw protease from -80 C. 
#. Add correct amount of buffer into each well. 
#. Add correct amount of protease into each well. 
#. Add 2 uL of diluted compound into wells assigned for different concentrations. 
#. Incubate. 30 mins, 37 C. 
#. Thaw substrate from -20 C. 
#. Retrieve well plate from incubator. 
#. Add 1.6 uL of substrate into each well.
#. Incubate. 120 mins, 37 C.  
#. Read plate at 350 nm excitation and 440 nm emission.   

**Analysis**

:math:`\text{Inhibition (%)} = \frac{\text{NT}-\text{T}}{\text{NT}}\times 100\%`

* NT = Non-treated
* T = Treated
