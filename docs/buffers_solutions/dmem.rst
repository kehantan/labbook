DMEM
=====

In this lab, we prepare 1 L of DMEM from powder. We then aliquote from 1 L of DMEM to smaller vial and mix with FBS and Pen-Strep to make complete DMEM. 

Requires
--------
* Autoclaved Milli-Q water (1 L)
* Vacuum filter cup with 0.22 Âµm filter 
* DMEM powder
* Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)
* Magnetic stirrer
* Autoclaved empty bottle (1L)
* Vacumm pump

Procedure
---------
#. Weight 3.7 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) as per instruction stated in `Thermo Fisher Scientific website <https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/12100046?SID=srch-srp-12100046>`_.

    The website states the concentration of NaHCO3 should be 3.7 g/L

#. Open DMEM powder and decant whole packet into autoclaved Milli-Q water.
#. Clean magnetic stirring bar with 70% ethanol. Drop into the bottle.
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until DMEM powder completely dissolve in the Milli-Q water.
#. Add sodium bicarbonate into DMEM.  
#. Filter DMEM into new 1 L autoclaved empty bottle.
