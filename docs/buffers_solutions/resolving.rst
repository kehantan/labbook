Resolving buffer
================

**Objective:** To prepare 1.5 M of Tris-HCl buffer with pH 8.8 for stacking gel. 

**Materials** 

* Tris-HCl (MW: 157.6; 1.5 M, pH 8.8)
* Distilled water 
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips 
* HCl
* Magnetic stirrer

**Procedure** 

#. Add 7.88 g of Tris-HCl into 50-100 mL of distilled water. Stir untill Tris-HCl powder completely dissolved. 

    * 1 M = 157.6 g/L; 1.5 M = 236.4 g/L = 23.64 g/100 mL

#. Adjust pH to 8.8 with NaOH.
#. Top up with distilled water untill 100 mL. 
#. Label and store at 4 C.
