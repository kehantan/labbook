Protein purification
====================

..
    This doc needs to be restructured
    Split into smaller sections if needed 


Protein purification is quite a long procedure where multiple samples will be collected for further testing. All the samples (I mean ALL, both supernatant and precipitate) will be stored until the target protein was obtained. Therefore, it is important to clearly label every tubes/containers used. 


Requires

* Ice box filled with ice
* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 mL)
* PCR tube
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Ni-NTA resin 
* Lysis buffer
* Buffer B
* Buffer C
* Buffer D 
* Rotator


Buffers 
-------

Before begin, prepare the buffers. Preferrably one day before, because adjusting pH of buffers takes quite some time.  


**Lysis buffer**


**Buffer B**

**Buffer D** 

We would need at least 3 L of buffer D for one purification.

The bacterial pellet from expression process was stored at -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C. Purification would proceed from there.  


Protein extraction
------------------

#. From the bacterial pellet from 500 mL culture. 

    Recap: The bacterial pellet from the 500 mL culture was seperated into 2 x 50 mL centrifuge tube. 

    We would use both tube for protein extraction and purification

#. Add 5 mL of lysis buffer into each centrifuge tube and suspend the pellet completely. Use a vortex if necessary. 

    It is normal for the suspension to become slimy/sticky when lysis buffer was added

#. Combine the suspension of both tube into a single 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Leave the centrifuge tube at room temperature for 30 mins.

    Optional: Rotate the centrifuge tube at 60 rpm with a rotator. 

    Can prepare Ni-NTA while waiting for the incubation. 

#. Homogenise using ultrasonic homogeniser at 8000 rpm, 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C for 15 mins. 

    * Look for a small plastic beaker which is 10 mL or 20 mL in volume under the 'glassware' cabinet. 
    * Plastic beaker is used because the sonic pulse might break glass beaker. 
    * Place the sample in the plastic beaker and submerge the beaker in ice bucket to maintain the suspension at 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C.
    * Because we added 25 mL of lysis buffer into the pellet and the small plastic beaker cannot contain all 25 mL of liquid at once, we can seperate the suspension into two portion and homogeinise seperately.
    * BRANSON SONIFIER 450, big horn, using glass beaker; output 10-20, Duty cycle 70%, 2 sec on, 0.5 sec off, for 1-2 min, on ice. 

#. Transfer the sonicated suspension into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge at 8000 rpm, 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, for 15 mins.  


Protein purification
--------------------

Continue after the centrifuge from last section. 


**Preparation of Ni-NTA resin**

#. Mix the Ni-NTA solution well before use. 

    Ni-NTA would form a thick gel-like layer at the bottom of the container. Invert the container multiple times to resuspend the gel-like substance completely into the solution. 

#. Add 2.5 mL of Ni-NTA resin into 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min.
#. Remove supernatant.

    The precipitate can easily resuspend into the solution with the slightest movement, so remove slowly, steadily and with care. 

#. suspend pellet with 5 mL of Buffer B. 
#. Centrifuge at 500 x g (or 3,000 rpm) for 5 min.
#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Keep the 50 mL centrifuge with Ni-NTA in ice until later use. 


**Protein purification from prepared pellet (after lysis)**

#. Remove supernatant from the centrifuged tube.

    Take 100-120 :math:`\mu`\ L of supernatant for SDS-PAGE later (**sample #0**)

#. Add 2-5 mL of Buffer B to the pellet and vortex well. 
#. Adjust the volume to 24 mL with Buffer B. 

    Take 100-120 :math:`\mu`\ L for SDS-PAGE later (**sample #1**)

#. Cool the sample on ice for 30 mins to 1 hr. 
#. Devide the suspensions into 24 microcentrifuge tubes.
#. Centrifuge at 20,000 - 27,000 g, 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, for 10 mins. 
#. Collect supernatant.
#. To make SDS-PAGE sample, add 1 mL of lysis buffer or Buffer B to pellet and mix well. 

    Keep 120 :math:`\mu`\ L of suspended pellet and supernatant for SDS-PAGE sample (**sample #2, sample #3**)

#. Add supernatant to Ni-NTA resin

    Store all pellet in their respective microcentrifuge tube at 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C

#. Rotate at 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C for 30 mins to 1 hr. 

    Bring the rotator into the cold room

#. Centrifuge at 500 g (or 3000 rpm) for 5 mins at 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C. 
#. Collect supernatant into new microcentrifuge tube. (**sample #4**)
#. Add 10 mL Buffer B into the Ni-NTA resin. 
#. Centrifuge again at 500 g (or 300 rpm) for 5 mins at 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C.
#. Collect supernatant into new microcentrifuge tube. (**sample #5**)

    This is basically a washing process. 

#. Transfer Ni-NTA resin to column using Buffer B. 
#. Collect flow through and keep 120 :math:`\mu L` for SDS-PAGE. 
#. Add 10 mL of Buffer B and collect the elution. Repeat this process for 3 times.   

    Keep 120 :math:`\mu`\ L of each elution for SDS-PAGE (**sample #6, sample #7**)

#. Add 2 mL of Buffer C and collect the elution. (**sample #8**)
#. Repeat the previous steps for 3 more times. 4 fractions will be collected. (**sample #9, sample #10, sample #11**)
#. Add 2 mL of Buffer C and collect the elution. (**sample 12**)
#. Run SDS-PAGE and stain with CBB for all 12 samples. 

    SDS-PAGE for this uses about 12-15% gel.


SDS-PAGE 
--------


Dialysis
--------

* Dialysis was done with Thermo Fisher Scientific Slide-A-lyzer Dialysis Casssette.
* This procedure needs to be carried out in cold room.
* It is best to pre-cool Buffer D to 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, so bring the buffer into cold room at least 1 hr before starting the procedure. 
* Other equipments needed in the cold room including magnetic stirrer and retort stand. 


**Procedure** 

Select 2-3 fractions containing NS2B/NS3 Protein. Leave 120 :math:`\mu`\ L for SDS-PAGE. 

#. With a syringe and needle, inject the fractions into the cassette. 
#. Submerge the cassette into Buffer D. 
#. Leave the set up in the cold room for 1 hr in the cold room. 
#. After 1 hr, change the buffer. Leave the set up for another 1 hr. 
#. After 1 hr, change the buffer. Leave the set up overnight. 
#. Collect the dialysised solution from cassette into centrifuge tube. 
#. Store the solution at 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C. 

    Collect 120 :math:`\mu`\ L for SDS-PAGE
