Substrate optimisation
======================

**Objective:** To determine the optimum concentration of substrate to be used in protease inhibition assay

**Requires**

* 96 well plate, black
* Substrate (MCA)
* Stock buffer (1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)
* Purified protease
* Autoclaved Milli-Q water

**Procedure**

*Prepare working buffer solution*

Prepare working buffer solution (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) from stock buffer solution (1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)

#. To prepare 10 mL of working buffer solution, add 2 mL of stock buffer solution into 8 mL of Milli-Q water. 

*Prepare substrate dilution*
