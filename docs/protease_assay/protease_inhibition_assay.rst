Protease inhibition assay
=========================

Reference for protease assay protocol: :cite:p:`ihssen_fluorogenic_2021`. 
There are several standard curve that need to be plotted before we carry out protease assay with the compounds that we wanted to test.  

* Protease activity 
* Substrate standard curve 

**Requires**

* Stock buffer
* Standard substrate (MCA)
* DMSO 
* Microcentrifuge tube 

**Procedure**

#. Prepare substrate standard
