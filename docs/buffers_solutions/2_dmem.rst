2% DMEM 
=======

* 2% DMEM is used for cell culture related to virus. 
* Prepare 2% DMEM in biosafety cabinet. 
* 2% indicates this culture media contain a total of 2% FBS in volume

**Requires**

* FBS
* Pen-Strep
* :ref:`DMEM <dmem>`
* Centrifuge tube (50 mL)
* Sodium pyruvate (if required)

**Procedures**

#. Into 50 mL centrifuge tube, aliquote:

   * 48 mL of DMEM

      We only have 25 mL serological pipette, so to prepare 48 mL, we can split into 24 mL twice 

   * 1 mL of FBS
   * 500 uL of Pen-strep
   * 500 uL of sodium pyruvate 

#. Mix well. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube.

   Label example: :code:`2% DMEM, name initials, date prepared`

#. Seal with parafilm. Store in fridge (4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C).

**Note**

* Final concentration for sodium pyruvate is usually 1 mM.
* The volume of sodium pyruvate to add into complete DMEM depends on the concentration of the sodium pyruvate stock solution. Adjust the volume of DMEM to compensate the volume changes in sodium pyruvate.
