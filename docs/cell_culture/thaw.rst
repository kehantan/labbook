Thawing cells
=============

Thawing cells from either -80 °C or from liquid nitrogen (LN2). 

Requires

* T25 culture flask
* Complete DMEM

*Reminder: Before starting the procedures, warm up medium in 37 C water bath. You can also put your apparatus in the biosafety cabinet and UV them first.*  

**Procedure**

#. Take cryovial from -80 °C  or LN2 tank.
#. Dispense 5 ml of complete DMEM into a T25 culture flask.
#. Thaw the cryovial with cells in 37 °C water bath.
   
     Thawing cells rapidly ensures high cell viability.

#. Optional step to remove cryopreservant and non-viable cells: resuspend cells in medium and briefly centrifuge (150–300 g for 3–5 min.). Resuspend cell pellet in fresh medium.
#. Transfer freshly thawed cells into culture flask with micropipette.
#. Change media after 24 hrs to remove DMSO.
