Trypan blue
===========

If commercially prepared trypan blue solution is available, we can aliquot into smaller vial. If the solution is not available, we would have to prepare manually. 

Aliquote from bottle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Objective:** To aliquot trypan blue solution into smaller vial. 

* Trypan blue comes as a stock solution in a bottle.
* Just aliquote into a smaller vial and it is ready to be used. 
* Because we usually do not use large amount of trypan blue, it should be sufficient to aliquote it into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
* Trypan blue can be stored at bench for future use. 
* It is not necessary to aliquote trypan blue in biosafety cabinet. 

**Requires**

* Trypan blue solution
* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 mL)

**Procedure**

#. Aliquote around 1 mL of trypan blue from the trypan blue stock solution into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Label the microcentrifuge tube. 

    Label example: :code:`Trypan blue, date aliquot, name initials`

#. Store at bench. 

Prepare trypan blue from powder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Objective:** Prepare trypan blue solution from trypan blue powder

Typical trypan blue solution for staining cells is 0.4% (w/v). 
 
#. Weight 0.04 g of trypan blue powder into 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Add 10 mL of PBS into the centrifuge tube. 
#. Vortex to completely dissolve the trypan blue powder.
#. Filter the prepared trypan blue solution with 0.22 uM syringe filter into a new 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Vortex to dissolve the trypan blue powder completely. 

* To prepare 10 mL of trypan blue solution, weight 0.04 g of trypan blue powder into 10 mL of PBS. 
* To prepare 100 mL of trypan blue solution, weight 0.4 g of trypan blue powder into 100 mL of PBS.
