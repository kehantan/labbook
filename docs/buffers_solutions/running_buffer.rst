.. _running buffer:

Running buffer
==============

* Running buffers are used for SDS PAGE
* This protocol prepares running buffer in 1x concentration, another way is to prepare 10x and dilute to 1x when we wanted to use.
* Volume = 1 L 
* pH 8.3 (pH of final solution should be around 8.3, no adjustment required)

**Recipe**
