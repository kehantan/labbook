Bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA)
==============================

**Objective:** To quantify concentration of protein in a sample using BCA. 

* We use kit for this assay. Can refer the procedure from manufacturer website or the manual provided in the box.  
* This procedure can be carried out on bench. 

**Materials**

* PCR centrifuge tube 
* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 mL)
* 96 well plate
* Distilled water 
* BCA kit 
* Microplate reader

**Procedure**

**Prepare BCA reagent solution**

Before we run the experiment, we have to prepare Reagent A:Reagent B:Reagent C in ratio of 25:24:1. This information can be found on manufacturer's website. Calculate how much reagent needed for your experiments.

*Prepare serial dilution of sample*

#. Prepare and label 8 microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Dispense 60 uL of distilled water into each microcentrifuge tube except the first tube. 
#. Aspirate 120 mL of sample into first microcentrifuge tube. Mix with repeat pipetting.  
#. Trasfer 60 uL of sample + distilled water mixture into second microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Repeat the dilution process from second microcentrifuge tube untill the last tube. 
#. Discard 60 uL of mixture from the last microcentrifuge tube.  

*Prepare different concentration of standard solution*

We would prepare different concentration of BCA stanadard (Albumin): 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000 ug/mL. To prepare different concentrations of standard solution, dilute the standard solution that included in the kit with distilled water.  

#. Prepare and label 8 microcentrifuge tubes. 
#. Add appropriate amount of distilled water into each microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Add appropriate amount of standard into each microcentrifuge tube. Mix the standard and distilled water by repeat pipetting. 

*In 96 well plate*

#. Label the 96 well plate. 
#. Add 50 uL of each standard solution into different wells.

    * For blank, just add 50 uL of distilled water into one well. 

#. Add 50 uL of reagent solution into each well, including the blank well. Mix well.  
#. Add 50 uL of different concentrations of sample into different wells. 
#. Add 50 uL of reagent solution into each sample wells. Mix the reagent solution and the sample solution by repeat pipetting. 
#. Incubate for 1 hr at 37 C.
#. Read absorbance at 562 nm.
