Cell culture waste
==================

There are some department policy for waste management that our lab is required to follow because the virus is considered an infectious agent. They may not always make sense, but it is here for documentation purpose. 

* There are specific beaker for cell culture waste. If you are doing cell related work, use the unlaballed waste beaker.
* Solid waste (pipette tips, culture flask, etc.) can be discarded into yellow bin in the lab after discarding the liquid waste into the sink. 
* Rinse the waste beaker with tap water. 
* Dry it on the rack beside the sink.
