MTT reagent
===========

**Objective:** To prepare MTT reagent from MTT powder. 

* Est. preparation time = 10 mins 
* MTT comes in powder form. 
* Concentration of MTT we use in this lab is 5 mg/mL, can adjust to other concentrations for different use case.  
* MTT solution can be prepared on bench. 
* MTT solution is sensitive to light. Wrap the prepared solution in aluminium foil before storing in freezer. 
* Schematics for preparing MTT solution can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IIiZSPVcTfXI2qt4P9eORFXnCTqsc18I3t5ufM8Zi7M/edit?usp=sharing>`_.

**Materials**

* MTT powder 
* Distilled water or PBS
* Centrifuge tube
* Syringe
* Syringe filter (0.22 um)
* Aluminium foil
* Weighing balance 
* Spatula 

**Procedure**

#. Weight 0.05 g (50 mg) of MTT powder and transfer into a centrifuge tube. 
#. Add 10 mL of distilled water in to the centrifuge tube.

    * We can use either distilled water or PBS to dissolve MTT powder. 
    * If prepare using PBS it is advisable to prepare in a biosafety cabinet under sterile environment. 

#. Vortex the solution until MTT is completely dissolve. 

    * Dissolve as much MTT powder as possible. Usually the powder would not dissolve completely, leaving behind some small chunks of solids. This is ok, we will filter it out in the next step.
    * Or you can use a sonicator to break all the small clumps. 

#. Filter with syringe filter. 
#. Wrap the centrifuge tube with aluminium foil. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube. 

    * Label example: :code:`MTT, 5 mg/mL, name initials, date prepared`

#. Store MTT working solution in -20 C.
