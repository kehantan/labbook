Protease activity assay
=======================

**Objective:** To quantify the activity of the purified protease. 

This step is required before we do protease inhibition assay with compounds.  

Prepare stock solutions and buffers before we actually start the procedure, preferably one day before the experiment day. Usually the buffers and stock solutions can be stored in 4 C for future use. 

**Requires** 

* Buffer
* Purified protease
* MCA substrate
* Black 96 well plate 

**Procedure**

#. Purified protease is stored in -80 C. Thaw it before use.
#. Prepare different concentrations of protease (0 to 100 mM). 
#. Prepare constant concentration (200 mM) of substrate.
#. In a black 96 well plate, add 10 uL of substrate into 90 uL of protease of different concentrations. 
#. Incubate. 37 C, 30 mins. 
#. Read plate at 350 nm emission and 440 nm excitation.
#. If the curve does not reach a plateau, incubate another 30 mins. 

*Note:* Plot the curve of protease activity, find the Vmax and Km value. Use the Km value as the concentration for substrate optimisation.
