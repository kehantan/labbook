SDS-PAGE
========

* 2 stages: casting gel, and running gel

Prepare gel 
-----------

* Two gels need to be prepared: resolving gel and stacking gel. 
* The protocol can be found in BIO-RAD's 'Handcasting Polyacrylamide Gels' documentation 
* Depending on the number of gels to be run, we do not need to prepare the amount as stated in the documentation. We can half the amount stated in the documentation. 

**Requires**

* 30% Acrylamide/bis (PAGE Pre-solution)
* 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8
* 1.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 
* :ref:`10% SDS <sds>`
* :ref:`10% APS <aps>`
* Distilled water
* TEMED 

**Procedure** 

#. Prepare 2 small beaker for resolving gel and stacking gel. Prepare 1 larger beaker for distilled water. 
#. Prepare the resolving and stacking gel solution according to the table, but leave out TEMED.

    The sequence is to cast resolving gel first then only cast stacking gel. Can prepare the resolving gel first, then prepare stacking gel. Not necessary to prepare both together. 

Casting gel
-----------

**Requires**

* Casting frame 
* Casting stand
* Tall glass plate
* Short glass plate 
* Wash bottle filled with distilled water

**Procedure**

Setup
~~~~~

Refer to Youtube videos on how to setup the gel casting apparatus. 

#. Put short glass plate infront of tall glass plate, with the opening in the middle of the two plates. 
#. Place the glass plate sandwich into casting frame. 

    Make sure the bottom of glass plates are aligned with the casting frame and flat. 

    The glass plates should only go into the casting frame in one way. 

#. Secure the casting frame on the casting stand with the clip on the top. 
#. With a wash bottle filled with distilled water, dispense small amount of distilled water to the bottom of the glass plates. 

    This step is to make sure there are no leakage and the setup is secured

#. Remove the distilled water. 

    Can either remove with a filter paper or just decant the water into sink. 

#. After the distilled water was removed, the gel is ready to cast. 

Casting resolving gel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Add TEMED into the resolving gel solution. 
#. Pipette the resolving gel solution into the glass sandwich via the opening.
#. Fill the resolving gel to about 2 cm from the top of the glass sandwich. 
#. Add distilled water on top of resolving gel. 
#. Let it sit for about 30 mins. The resolving gel should solidifies after 30 mins. 

    One way to check it is by looking through the casted gel. The distilled water and the gel should form 2 seperate layers, with a barely visible fine line between the layers.  

#. Remove the water on top of the resolving gel. 

    Can either remove with a filter paper of just decant the water into sink

Casting stacking gel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Add TEMED into the stacking gel solution. 
#. Pipette the stacking gel solution into the glass sandwich via the opening.
#. Fill the stacking gel to the top of the glass sandwich. 
#. Place the comb into the stacking gel. 
#. Let it sit for about 30 mins. The stacking gel should solidifies after 30 mins. 
#. After 30 mins, slowly remove the comb. The gel should be ready to be loaded with samples. 

Prepare sample
--------------

**Requires**

* PCR tubes
* Thermal cycler
* Sample buffer

**Procedure**

#. Prepare PCR tube and label them. 

    Depending on how many samples you wanted to load into the gel. 

#. Aliquot sample and sample buffer into the PCR tubes at a 1:1 ratio. 

    This requires optimisation. 5 to 10 uL could work. E.g.: 10 uL of sample + 10 uL of sample buffer

#. Spin down with a PCR centrifuge. 

    Spin for about 15 secs

#. Load the PCR tubes with samples into the thermal cycler. 
#. Set the thermal cycler. 95 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, 5 mins. 
#. Run the thermal cycler.

Sample loading
--------------

* Depends on the gel you casted (there are different thickness for the gels), the volume of the sample wells can varies. 
* I usually just use 10 uL that consist of sample + sample buffer mixture at a ratio of 1:1 

**Requires**

* Ladder 

**Procedure**

#. Aspirate 5 uL of ladder with micropipette. 
#. Place the micropipette tip directly on the top of the first well of the gel. 
#. Dispense the sample slowly. The ladder sample should drop directly into the wells.
#. Repeat the steps again, aspirate 10 uL of sample + sample buffer mixture and dispense into each well.   

Running gel
-----------

**Requires**

* Buffer tank
* Running buffer
* Electrodes
* Power supply unit 

**Procedure**

#. Make sure the electrodes are correctly attached.

    Red to red, black to black

#. Set the power supply unit. 

    300 V, 50 amp, around 70 mins.

    For some older units, the voltage might not be constantly sitting at 300 V. It is alright as long as the amp is stable. 

#. Start the electrophoresis. 

    Many tiny bubbles will bee seen raising from the bottom of the gel to the surface 

#. Observe the progress of the eletrophoresis every 15 mins to make sure not to overrun. 

    Stop the electrophoresis when the ladder reaches about 1 cm from the bottom of the gel. 

Staining
--------

**Requires**

* Coomasie blue
* Rocking platform
* Plastic container

**Procedure**

#. Get a plastic container. 
#. Fill the plastic container with Coomasie blue stain to about 1 cm of height.
#. Place the gell into the container. 
#. Rock the container on the rocking platform. 

    Depends on the concentration of the stain and amount of protein present in the sample for SDS-PAGE. It might take 30 mins to several hours

#. Check the results

Clean up
--------

* The remaining gel solution in the small beaker from resolving gel and stacking gel would solidify over time. When this happens, break the gel (with any stuff you could find, like pipette tips or spatula) then dispose in the yellow bin. **DO NOT** throw in the sink. 
* Buffers can be flush down the sink. 
* wash all apparatus and leave it to dry at the rack beside the sink.
