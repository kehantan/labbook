Cryopreservation of cells
=========================
This procedure uses 500 uL of cell suspension for each cryopreservation tube. Depending on the final volume of your cell suspension, calculate how many tubes you can cryo. For example, if the final volume of cell suspension is 3 ml, then you can cryo up to 6 tubes. 

Requires
--------
* DMSO
* Cryopreservation tube
* Complete DMEM

Procedure
---------
#. Trypsinise the cells from culture flask.
    
    Refer to the trypsinise Reference `trypsinise`_.

#. In each cryopreservation tube, prepare: 

   * 450 uL complete DMEM

   * 50 uL DMSO

    Prepare freezing medium before adding to cells because concentrated DMSO is toxic to cells. 

#. Insert 500 uL of cell suspension into cryopreservation tube. 
#. Place cryopreservation tube in Mr. Frosty. 
#. Store in -80 °C overnight.
#. Transfer cryopreservation tube from -80 °C to liquit nitrogen tank. 

*Note: Cells can be stored for short term in -80 °C, but for long term storage, it is better to store in gas phase of liquid nitrogen.*
