MTT results
===========

* Most microplate reader allows the results to be easily export to MS Excel file. If not, have to convert them manually into an Excel sheet. 

**Workflow**

#. Average all the reading from the 3 wells of each concentrations (including blank and negative control wells). 
#. Minus off values from blank wells. This is to remove the background noise generated by DMSO (which we used as a blank).
#. Divide absorbance reading of each well by the absorbance reading of non-treated control. 
#. Multiply the value by 100 to convert to percentage. 
#. Plot graph in graphpad prism or any other software to calculate IC50.

:math:`\text{Inhibition (%)} = \frac{T}{NTC} \times 100\%` 

T = Treated

NTC = Non-treated control
