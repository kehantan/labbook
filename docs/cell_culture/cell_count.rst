Cell count
==========

**Materials**

* Counting chamber
* Counter
* Trypan blue
* 96 well plate (For mixing trypan blue and the cell suspension. You can use anything that works well for you, microcentrifuge tube, parafilm, etc.) 
* Micropipette
* Pipette tips 

**Procedure**

#. Before cell counting, trypsinise the cells from the culture flask. Refer to :ref:`trypsinise <My target>`.
#. Add 10 uL of trypan blue into one well of the 96 well plate.
#. Add 10 uL of cell suspension obtained from trypsinisation to the same well that have trypan blue. Mix by repeat pipetting. 

    * This example uses 1:1 ratio of cell suspension (10 uL) vs trypan blue (10 uL) for dilution. You can use other dilution factors like 1:4, 1:9, etc., just remember to also change the dilution factor during the calculation. 

#. Take 10 uL of the trypan blue and cell mixture and add to the counting chamber.

    * A counting chamber set up typically consist of a counting chamber with a glass cover slip on top. Add the trypan blue + cell mixture from the edge of cover slip. The capillary action will spread the mixture evenly across the counting area. 

#. Count the cells using microscope.

Calculations
------------

The formula for calculating number of cells in 1 mL of cell suspension:

:math:`\frac{\text{sum of cells from 4 quadrant} \times 10^4 \times \text{Dilution factor}}{4} = X\ \text{cells}/mL`

We would get value of :code:`X cells/mL`. 

Compare the number of cells required we calculated before we begin the experiment and the number of cells in 1 mL cell suspension we just calculated to make sure we have sufficient cells for seeding. In case there are not sufficient cells for all the experiments, may consider lowering the number of cells to seed, or reduce the number of plates to seed. 

**Dilution for cell count**

Counting large number of cells under microscope can be tiring and straining for the eyes. Therefore, instead of using 1:1 trypan blue to cell suspension ratio, we can use 1:4 (adding 10 uL of cell suspension into 40 uL of trypan blue), making the dilution factor become 5 to reduce the number of cells we need to count. When calculating the number of cells in the cell suspension, use 'x5' for dilution factor in the formula. You can also use other suitable ratio, just remember to use the correct dilution factor in the formula.
