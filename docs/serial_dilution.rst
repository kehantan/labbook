Serial dilution
===============

To prepare a mixture solution of different concentrations, we can do it two ways: 1) Serial dilution, 2) Prepare each individual concentration seperately.

Assume we have 100 mg of compound X and we wanted to prepare it in the following concentrations:

200 ug/ml, 100 ug/ml, 50 ug/ml, 25 ug/ml, 12.5 ug/ml, 6.25 ug/ml, 3.125 ug/ml

with each concentration consists of 600 uL of final volume. 

The common practice is to prepare a stock solution where we dissolve the solid compound in our preferred solvent (e.g.: distilled water, DMSO, etc.). For this example, we can dissolve 1 mg of compound X in 1 ml of DMSO, to make a 1 mg/ml stock solution. From the 1 mg/ml stock solution, we can further dilute it into the concentrations we want to test with complete DMEM. 

**Prepare each concentrations seperately**

Prepare it seperately means we would calculate the amount of stock solutions we need individually with :math:`C_1 \cdot V_1 = C_2 \cdot V_2`. 

:math:`1 mg/ml \times V_1 = 200 ug/ml \times 600 uL`

:math:`1000 ug/ml \times V_1 = 200 ug/ml \times 600 uL`

:math:`V_1 = \frac{200 ug/ml \times 600 uL}{1000 ug/ml}`

:math:`V_1 = 120 uL`

Our 1st concentration would be consists of 120 uL of stock solution of compound X (1 mg/mL) + 480 uL of complete DMEM = 600 uL of final volume.

So repeat this calculation again for all the other concentrations. Then we can start pipette into different centrifuge tube. 

**Prepare different concentrations with serial dilution**

#. Prepare 7 microcentrifuge tube. Label the concentrations on the tube. 

    200 ug/mL, 100 ug/mL, 50 ug/mL, 25 ug/mL, 12.5 ug/mL, 6.25 ug/mL, 3.125 ug/mL

#. Pipette 960 uL of complete DMEM into the microcentrifuge tube labelled with '200 ug/mL'. Then pipette 600 uL of complete DMEM into other microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Pipette 240 uL stock solution of compound X into the '200 ug/mL' microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by repeat pipetting.
#. Transfer 600 uL of liquid from the '200 ug/mL' microcentrifuge tube to the 100 ug/mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by repeat pipetting. 
#. Repeating the steps by pipetting 600 uL of liquid from the current microcentrifuge tube to the next microcentrifuge tube and mix well by repeat pipetting. 
#. For the last microcentrifuge tube (3.125 ug/ml in this example), discard 600 uL of liquid after mixing. 
#. Then we have a serial dilution.  

There are serial dilution calculator that can be found on the internet, you can use that. I would recommend familiar yourself with serial dilution as this is the standard method for preparing solutions. Also, it saves a little bit of time in terms of calculations and actual preparations.
