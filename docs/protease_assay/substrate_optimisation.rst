Substrate optimisation
======================

**Objective:** To determine the optimum concentration of substrate to be used in protease inhibition assay

**Requires**

* 384 well black plate
* Substrate (Boc-Gly-Arg-Arg-MCA)
* Stock buffer (1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5)
* Purified protease with known concentrations 
* Distilled water 

**Procedure**

*Prepare working buffer solution*

#. Add 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl into 4 mL of distilled water to obtained 200 mM of Tris-HCl working solution at pH 8.5. 

    * Adjust the volume if necessary. The ratio of 1 M Tris-HCl to distilled water needed is 1:4 to make 200 mM Tris-HCl

#. Mix well. Vortex if necessary. 

*Prepare substrate dilution*

        * We want to test 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 0 uM substrate with fixed concentration of protease. 
        * We want to use fixed volume of 10 uL of substrate.
        * So instead, we make different substrate concentration of 2,000, 1,000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25 uM. Because we wil be adding only 10 uL of the substrate into 90 uL of protease + buffer mixture, this cause the substrate to dilute 10 times in the final volume of 100 uL. 

#. Add calculated amount of working buffer solution into 96 well black plate. 
#. Add fixed amount of protease into 96 well black plate. 
#. Add 10 uL of different concentration of substrate into respective wells. 
#. Incubate for 30 mins at room temperature. 
#. Read plate at 350 nm excitation and 440 nm emission every 2 mins for a total of 60 mins.
