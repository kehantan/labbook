Cell culture
============

Protocols for different cell culture related procedures.

Refer `here <https://www.healthcare.nikon.com/en/ss/cell-image-lab/knowledge/process.html>`_ for the work cycle of cell culture. 


A typical process of cell culture including following steps:

#. Trypsinise
#. Cell count 
#. Cell seeding
#. Further procedures (subculture, MTT, plaque assay, etc.)

Trypsinisation is a common procedure for almost all assays. Whether we wanted to subculture or conduct any other assays, we would have to trypsinise the cells from culture flask, then only we proceed with other steps.  

**Before we start any procedure...**

Maintain good aseptic technique is important throughout the whole process of cell culture. The usual prep for using the biosafety cabinet (BSC) is to sanitise the surfaces inside the BSC with 70% ethanol, then turn on UV for about 15-30 mins. You can reduce the time if you don't want to wait for that long. 

The common items for doing cell culture including:

* Micropipette (10-100 uL and 100-1000 uL)
* Micropipette tips
* Serological pipette (5 ml and 10 ml)
* Pipette gun
* Waste beaker
* Paper towel
* Centrifuge tube (15 ml)
* Culture flask (T25/T75)
* Permanent Marker

You can also place these items into the BSC and UV them first. But before placing any items into the BSC, spray the items with 70% ethanol. 

Common solutions we would be using for cell culture including: 

* Complete DMEM 
* TrypLE 

You do not need to UV the solutions, but it is best to pre-warm these solutions in 37 C water bath before cell culture. Usually it takes 5-10 mins to warm the solutions. 

Another common solutions we would be using for cell culture is phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Since we usually store PBS at bench/room temperature, we do not need to pre-warm them. 

We would place the solutions into the BSC only after UV was done, before we want to start any procedures. Remember to keep good aseptic techniques, spray 70% ethanol on the solution bottles before placing them into the BSC.
