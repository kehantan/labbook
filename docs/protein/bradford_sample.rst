Bradford assay for protein sample
=================================

**Objective:** To quantify the concentration of protein in a sample. 

* Before you do bradford assay for the purified protein sample, you will need to have the standard plot for bradford assay by using BSA to create different working solution with known protein concentrations. Then only we can measure the protein sample concentration by using the standard plot as reference.
