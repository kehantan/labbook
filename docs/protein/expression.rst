Protein expression
==================

**Objective:** To culture bacteria that will express the target recombinant protein. 

* Approximate time for total procedure: 10 hrs  

Section 1 - Preparation and small scale culture 
-----------------------------------------------

Prepare LB agar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* To prepare LB agar, follow the instructions on the LB agar bottle. 
* This procedure can be carried out on lab bench.
* If there are already extra agar plates prepared then this step can be skipped, but check the plates before use. Avoid using contaminated agar plates or agar plates with water vapour condenstaion inside.  

**Requires** 

* LB agar powder 
* Petri dish 
* Schott bottle (500 mL)
* Distilled water 
* Autoclave
* Kanamycin stock solution (30 mg/mL)
* Bunsen burner
* Lighter

**Procedure**

#. In a 500 mL bottle, dissolve LB powder in 250 mL distilled water. 
#. Add 250 uL of Kanamycin stock solution into LB agar solution. Final concentration of Kanamycin = 30 ug/mL
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until powder completely dissolve. 
#. Autoclave.

    * Set the autoclave mode to 'warm' instead or 'normal'. This would keep the agar at 60 C after autoclave is complete so the agar would not solidifies. 

#. Pour agar into petri dish. 
#. Wait until agar plate is cooled down, then wrap in plastic bag and store on bench. 

Prepare LB broth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* To prepare LB broth, follow the instructions on the LB broth bottle.
* This procedure can be carry out on lab bench.  

**Requires**

* Erlenmeyer flask (2 L)
* Weighting balance
* Spatula 
* LB broth powder 
* Distilled water 
* Measuring cylinder (1 L)
* Kanamycin stock solution (30 mg/mL)

**Procedure**

#. In a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask, dissolve 12.5 g of LB powder in 500 mL distilled water. Cover the mouth of the flask with aluminium foil. 
#. Autoclave. 120 C, 15 mins. 
#. Wait until the LB broth cools down, then add 500 uL of Kanamycin stock solution into LB broth. 
#. Cover the mouth of the flask with aluminium foil and store on bench. 

**Note:** For the ease of work, aside from preparing LB broth for large scale culture, prepare another smaller volume of LB broth in a 500 mL bottle used for various purpose such as small scale culture and as a blank for measuring the OD of the cultured bacteria. 

Small scale culture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Requires**

* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Transformed *E. coli* cultured on agar plate 
* Plastic inoculation loop
* Bunsen burner
* Lighter 

**Procedure** 
 
#. Prepare two 15 mL centrifuge tube. Add 10 mL of LB broth into each tube.
#. Aliquote 5 mL of broth into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 

    To be used as blank later. 

#. Pick a single *E. coli* colony from agar plate and mix with LB broth in the 15 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Shake the centrifuge tube. 24 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm.

Section 2 - Large scale culture
-------------------------------

**Requires**

* Spectrophotometer
* 2 L Erlenmeyer flask
* 2 L orbital shaker
* :ref:`IPTG stock solution (250 mM)<iptg>`
* Refrigerated centrifuge 
* PBS 
* Centrifuge tube (50 mL)
* Micropipette (1000 uL)
* Micropipette tip (1000 uL)

**Procedure**

#. Add the small scale culture from 15 mL centrifuge tube culture into the 500 mL LB broth prepared in section 1. 
#. Shake. 1 to 3 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm. 
#. Check OD at 600 nm every 1 hour. 
#. When OD is around 0.5 - 0.6, add 1 mL of IPTG stock solution to the LB broth culture.

    * IPTG final concentration in LB broth = 0.5 mM

#. Shake. 2 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm.
#. Transfer culture from flask into multiple 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 4000 rpm, 4 C, 10 mins. 

    * 4 C is preferrable, if not, room temp is fine. 

#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Resuspend pellet in 2000 uL PBS.  

    * Prepare another PBS for bacteria work to prevent contamination with PBS for cell culture use. 

#. Combine all resusupended pellet into two 50 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Top up PBS to 50 mL in each tube.  
#. Centrifuge. 3000 rpm, 4C, 10 mins.  
#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube.
#. Store pellet at -80 C.

    * Bacterial pellet can be stored in -80 C for months wihtout problem. 
    * Wrap the centrifuge tube in plastic bag before storing in -80 C to prevent contamination of other samples.
