Cell seeding for MTT assay
==========================

**Objective:** Seed cells for MTT assay.

* Estimated time needed: 1 hr
* :ref:`cell seeding for MTT assay <cell seed mtt>`
* After we know how much cells we have, we now need to know how much cells we need to take from the cell suspension and dilute in complete DMEM to make the final mixture we want. 
* Assume after counting the cells, we have: :code:`300*10^4 cells/mL`, but we only need :code:`5*10^4 cells/mL` (Remember we calculate this value before we begin the procedure). 

Using  

    .. code-block::

        C1V1 = C2V2
        300*10^4 cells/mL * V1 = 5*10^4 cells/mL * 5 mL
        V1 = 0.0833 mL (~83.3 uL) 
    
* In summary, we need to put **83.3 uL of cell suspension** into 4916.7 uL of media. But since the volume difference is negligible, we would just round up to **5,000 uL** of media. 

**Materials**

* 96 well plate 
* Cell reservoir
* Micropipette
* Multichannel micropipette
* Pipette tips 
* Serological pipette 
* Pipette gun 
* Waste beaker 

**Procedure**

#. Mix the cell suspension with either repeat pipetting or vortex. 
#. Add appropriate amount of complete DMEM into the cell reservoir. 

    * In this example, we should add 5,000 uL (5 mL) of complete DMEM into the cell resesrvoir.

#. Take required volume of cell suspension and mix with complete DMEM in the cell reservoir.

    * In this example, add 83.3 uL of cell suspension into the cell reservoir.

#. Mix the cells and media evenly by repeat pipetting using multichannel micropiptte. 
#. Add 100 uL of cells and complete DMEM mixture from the cell reservoir into the 96 well plate with multichannel micropipette. 
#. Incubate the seeded 96 well plate for 24 hrs at 37 C, 5% CO2.
