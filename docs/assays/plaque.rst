Plaque assay
============

Plaque assay is used to quantify the virus titer in a virus sample. I seperate this protocol into different sections, each section indicates that after that procedure was completed, you need to wait until another day to proceed to the next section. 

Section 1 - Trypsininse, cell count, seed cells
-----------------------------------------------

* Cells should be at least 90% confluency at the time of infection.
* Amount of cells harvested from a T75 flask with 80% confluency should be sufficient to seed at least 2 6 well plate with 600,000 cells in each well for next day virus infection.   
* Number of cells to seed depends on which day you want to do infection 

    * Seed 6 well plate with 600,000 cells per well for next day infection 
    * Seed 6 well plate with 400,000 cells per well for infection after 2 days 
    * Seed 12 well plate with 300,000 cells per well for next day infection

**Requires**

* :ref:`Complete DMEM <10 dmem>`
* 6 well plate/12 well plate

**Procedure**

#. Trypsinise the cells in culture flask. Refer to :ref:`trypsinise <My target>`.
#. Count the cells. Refer to :ref:`cell count <cell count>`. 
#. Check if there are enough cells for 6 well plate. Calculate the required amount of cell suspension to aspirate into each well.
#. Dispense 1.5 mL of complete DMEM in each well of the 6 well plate. 
#. Dispense required amount of cell suspension into each well. 
#. Tilt the 6 well plate back and forth and side to side to distribute the cells evenly across the base of the wells. 
#. Incubate for 24 hrs or longer depending on the number of cells you seed.

Section 2 - Infection
---------------------

After 24 hrs incubation, infect cells with virus. 

*Note:* For steps involving virus, avoid using seropipette. As our lab policy requires virus waste to be handled seperately, using seropipette to handle virus can make disposal of the serological pipette difficult. It is easier to dispose pipette tips than the serological pipette.

**Requires**

* :ref:`2% DMEM <2 dmem>`
* Microcentrifuge tube
* :ref:`Agarose (5%) <agarose>`
* Virus stock
* :ref:`Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) <pbs>`

Dilution of virus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before the actual infection procedure, we need to prepare a serial diultion from the virus stock. 

#. Prepare microcentrifuge tube equivalent to the number of dilutions you wanted to do. 
#. Take virus sample from -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C. 
#. Thaw virus sample in 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C water bath. 
#. Do a serial dilution of the virus stock by diluting the virus with 2% DMEM in microcentrifuge tube. Can start from 1 to 5 times dilution factor. 

    #. Label 5 microcentrifuge tube. 

        Label example: :math:`10^{-1}`, :math:`10^{-2}`, :math:`10^{-3}` ... 

    #. Dispense 450 uL of 2% DMEM into each tube. 
    #. Dispense 50 uL of virus stock into the first tube (:math:`10^{-1}`). 
    #. Mix well by either pipette repeatedly or using a vortex.
    #. Transfer 50 uL of diluted virus from first tube to second tube (:math:`10^{-2}`). 
    #. Mix well by either pipette repeatedly or using a vortex.
    #. Repeat the process for each tube until the last tube.

Infection
~~~~~~~~~

#. Label each well.

    Label example: NC, :math:`10^{-1}`, :math:`10^{-2}`, :math:`10^{-3}`, etc.

#. Remove existing media from each well with serological pipette. 

    Aspirate media from wall of the well to prevent scratching on the cell layer

    For this step we can still use serological pipette because the virus is not introduced to the wells yet. 

#. Wash cells with PBS.

   #. Dispense 300 uL of PBS into each well from the wall of each well. 

        There are actually no fixed amount to use, just need to cover the cell layer. I usually use 300 uL. 
    
        Dispense from the wall of each well to prevent detaching the cell layer due to pressure from micropipette. 

   #. Tilt the plate side to side and back and forth for a few times to porperly wash the cells. 

#. Add 300 uL of 2% DMEM in negative control well.
#. Add 300 uL of diluted virus into corresponding well. 

    Remember to vortex the mircocentrifuge tube to mix the virus before adding the virus to the well. 

#. Incubate the 6 well plate at 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C for 1 hour. Tilt the plate every 20 mins. 
#. After 1 hour, overlay the infected cell layer with agarose. 

Agarose overlay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Prepare agarose by heating the solidified agarose in a microwave oven. 
  
    Heat until the agarose melts and boils, but do not let agarose bubble for too long, as it will evaporate the water content in the agarose. Let the agarose bubbling for 1 or 2 seconds should be sufficient. 

#. In a 15 ml centrifuge tube, add 9 mL of 2% DMEM and 1 mL of agarose. 

    Mix the agarose and 2% DMEM by repeating pipette. You can also invert the tube few times to mix the agarose and media. 

#. Remove existing media from the 6 well plate. 

    Don't use serological pipette for this step. Use a regular pipette with pipette tips. 

#. Wash the cells 2 times with PBS.
#. Dispense 1.5 mL of agarose and 2% DMEM mixture into each well. 

    You can use a serological pipette for this step 

    Dispense the mixture from the wall of each well

#. Leave the 6 well plate in room temperature for 10 to 15 mins.
#. Agarose should hardens after around 10 mins. 

    You can slightly tilt the plate to check if the agarose solidifies. 

    Do not tilt the plate at an overly steep angle as the agarose will torn apart upon its own weight. 

#. Transfer the 6 well plate into CO2 incubator. 

It usually takes 24 hrs for the CPE to form, and another 24 hrs for the cell infected with virus to die. So usually after 48 hrs of incubation, we can fix and stain the plaque. 

Section 3 - Fix and stain 
-------------------------
We use crystal violet to stain the cells that are attached to the 6 well plate. The dead cells would detached from the 6 well plate and get washed away, leaving behind a clear spot after staining. 

**Requires**

* :ref:`Paraformaldehyde (PFA), 3.7% <pfa>`
* Crystal violet

**Procedure**

#. Dispense 3.7% PFA into each well to fix the cells for 1 hr.
    
    Use the bench use micropipette
    
    There are no fix volume, just need to cover the cell layer. 300 uL should be enough. 

    Dispense from the wall of each well. 
    
    It is normal for the agarose to torn apart or disintegrate once the PFA was applied 

#. Remove PFA after 1 hr. 

    Using a micropipette, remove the PFA and discard into waste bottle labelled 'chemical waste'. The bottle is stored under the laminar flow cabinet in the lab.

#. Rinse the plate in a bucket of water for a few times to wash away the agarose. 

    Fill a bucket with tap water first, then immerse the plate into the bucket. Wait for 1 or 2 seconds, then take out the plate. Repeat the process for a few times. 

#. Decant excess water from 6 well plate by slightly tapping the plate facing downwards against a paper towel. 
#. Stain the wells with crystal violet for 2 to 3 mins. 

    No fix volume required, just need to cover the cell layer. 300 uL should be enough. 

    Dispense from the wall of each well. 

#. Tilt the plate to make sure crystal violet covers the all areas within the wells. 
#. Remove the crystal violet.

    We usually reuse the crystal violet, so pipette the crystal violet in the wells back into the tube which stores crystal violet 

#. Rinse the plate in a bucket of water for a few times to wash away excess crystal violet. 

    This action is similar to how we rinse away the agarose.  

#. Decant excess water from 6 well plate by slightly tapping the plate facing downwards against a paper towel. 
#. Leave the plate on bench to air dry. 

This protocol shows how to work with 6 well plate. If you want to do plaque assay in a 12 well plate, there are slight changes need to be made. 

* Cell seeding - 300,000 cells per well for next day infection 
* Use 1 mL of media instead of 1.5 mL

Clean up
--------

Refer to :ref:`virus waste <virus waste>` management. 

* There are specific blue plastic bag under the fume hood in the lab for disposing virus related waste. 
* Usually the plates that were fixed and stained would be kept in the dark (inside cabinet). 
* Some plates were not fixed because there are no plaque observed under microscope, so there is no use to proceed with fixing and staining. You can still fix and stain if you insist to, but if you wanted to dispose, dispense small amount of clorox into each well before disposing the plate into the blue plastic bag.
