Cell count
==========

To get an estimation of how many cells are there in a culture flask. 


Requires

* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Counting chamber
* Counter
* Trypan blue
* 96 well plate (for mixing trypan blue and the cell suspension)


*Reminder:* Before starting the procedures, warm up medium and TrypLE in 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C water bath. You can also put your apparatus in the biosafety cabinet and UV them first.  


**Procedure**

**Trypsinise**

Refer to :ref:`trypsinise <My target>`.


**Cell counting**

#. Pipette 10 uL of trypan blue into one well of the 96 well plate.
#. Pipette 10 uL of cell suspension from centrifuge tube to the well that have trypan blue. Mix by repeat pipetting. 

    * You can use higher volume as long as it is 1:1 ratio (e.g.: 10 uL of trypan blue + 10 uL of cell suspension)
    * There are other approach on the internet, you can always choose to use those method if you find those approach more convenient or easier to understand. As long as the ultimate objective is to know how many cells are there in a single culture flask. 

#. Take 10 uL of the trypan blue and cell mixture, and dispense into the counting chamber.
#. Count the cells. 

The formula for calculating number of cells in 1 mL of cell suspension

:math:`\frac{\text{sum of cells from 4 quadrant} \times 10^4 \times 2}{4} = X cells/ml`


*Note:*

At the end of :ref:`trypsinise <My target>` section, the protocol is resuspending the cell pellet in 1 mL of fresh complete DMEM. There are several modifications you can do depending on what your further plans are.

For T25 that has cell confluency of 90% or above, or T75 that has cell confluency of 70% or above, you can add more fresh complete DMEM, to a cell suspension volume of 2 mL or 3 mL. The purpose is to ease the cell counting steps, so you don't have to count large amount of cells under microscope, which can cause strain to your eyes. 

  * For T25 with cell confluency of 90% or above, I would recommend to add complete DMEM until the cell suspension is 2 mL. 
  * For T75 with cell confluency of 70% or above, I would recommend to add complete DMEM until the cell suspension is 3 mL. 

These are not strict instructions, just some suggestions which can help ease your workflow. You can of course, adjust the volume of cell suspension according to your need. Under certain circumstances, like when you wanted to cryopreserve the cells, you might not want to add more complete DMEM, because you want highest number of cells in a smaller volume to ensure cell viability.
