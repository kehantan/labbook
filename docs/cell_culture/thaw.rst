Thawing cells
=============

**Objective:** Revive the cells from cryopreserved state. 

**Materials**

* T25 culture flask
* :ref:`Complete DMEM <10 dmem>`
* Serological pipette 
* Pipette gun 
* Micropipette
* Pipette tips

**Procedure**

#. Warm complete DMEM in water bath to room temperature. 
#. Add 5 mL of complete DMEM into a T25 culture flask.
#. Take out cryovial from -80 C or LN2 tank.
#. Thaw the cryovial containing cells in 37 C water bath.
   
     * Thawing cells rapidly ensures high cell viability.

#. *Optional step:* to remove cryopreservant and non-viable cells: resuspend cells in medium and briefly centrifuge (150â€“300 x g for 3 to 5 mins). Resuspend cell pellet in fresh medium.
#. Transfer freshly thawed cells into culture flask with micropipette.
#. Label the flask.  

     * Label format: Cell type, cell passage, date, name initials
     * Label example: :code:`VERO P20 3/10/2023 TKH/NNR`
     * When labelling the flask, +1 to the passage number. Example: the cryovial labelled P19, when you revive the cells from the cryovial, label P20 on the culture flask.

#. Change media after 24 hrs to remove DMSO. You don't need to do this step if you already remove the cryopreservant when reviving the cells.
