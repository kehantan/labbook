Before we begin cell culture
============================

**Some ground rules**

Maintain good aseptic technique is important throughout the whole process of cell culture. 

The biosafety cabinet (BSC) is our main working bench for cell culture work. To reduce possibilities of contamination, adhere to aseptic techniques as strictly as possible. 

The regulars including always wear gloves and lab coat. 

Before putting anything into the BSC, we need to spray them with 70% ethanol (this including our hands). If you remove your hand from the BSC, touch something else, spray 70% ethanol before putting it into the BSC. 

**ITEMs for cell culture**

There are some common items for cell culture. It is best to find out which one you need to use for your procedures. 

   * Micropipette (10 to 100 uL and 100 to 1000 uL)
   * Micropipette tips
   * Serological pipette (5 mL and 10 mL)
   * Pipette gun
   * Waste beaker
   * Paper towel
   * Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
   * Culture flask (T25/T75)
   * Permanent Marker
   * 96 well plate for mixing trypan blue and cell suspension for cell count

      It doesn't necessarily have to be a 96 well plate. You can use anything that you find useful, some people use microcentrifuge tube, some people use parafilm. It's really up to your preference.  

   * Counting chamber (Neubauer chamber)

      You can place the whole counting chamber, including its box together into the BSC, or you can just place only the counting chamber in to the BSC. This is up to your preference. 

   * Well plates (96, 24, 12, etc.)
   * Cell scraper
   * Others

**REAGENTs for cell culture** 

Common reagents we would be using for cell culture including: 

* Complete DMEM 
* TrypLE 
* Trypan blue
* Phosphate buffer saline (PBS)

**UV**

Before we start a procedure, we should... 

#. Gather all the items and reagents you need into the basket in the lab 
#. Carry them to the cell culture room
#. Lift the window of the BSC to the sash level. Do not lift the window higher than the sash level. 
#. Spray the wall and surface in the BSC with 70% ethanol. 
#. Place the items you need for your procedures in the BSC 

    Remember to spray all the items with 70% ethanol before putting them into the BSC

#. Close the BSC window
#. Turn on the UV to sanitise the items 

    Turn on UV for about 15-30 mins. You can reduce the time if you don't want to wait for that long. 

You do not need to UV the reagents, instead pre-warm these reagents in 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C water bath before cell culture. Usually it takes 5 to 10 mins to completely warm the reagents. 

PBS and trypan blue (for cell counting) do not need to be pre-warmed since we store PBS and trypan blue at bench/room temperature. 

We would place the reagents into the BSC only after UV was done. Remember to keep good aseptic techniques, spray 70% ethanol on the reagent bottles/containers before placing them into the BSC. 

**Note**

You might run into certain circumstances where...

* You forget to UV some items 

    You can just spray them with 70% ethanol then putting them into the BSC, without UV beforehand 

* You took out your hand from the BSC for 2 seconds, do you need to spray with ethanol before putting it back into the BSC?

    As a general rule, I would advice to spray with ethanol, but its not the end of the world if you find it to tedious to do so. 

* You might have seen different approach of aseptic tecniques from different soures like the internet, forum, or you might learn the aseptic techniques from somewhere else. 

    You can adapt them as you see fit. 

*REMEMBER*: This is a general practice/rules/guidelines/protocols that we use in our lab. The goal is to reduce the chances of contamination as much as possible. No one will punish you for not following these practice. However, you are advised to adhere to these practice WHENEVER POSSIBLE. Whatever you do in the lab, use your own judgement, common sense, and logic. If unsure, can always discuss with lab mates or supervisors.
