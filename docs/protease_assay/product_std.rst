Product (AMC) standard curve
============================

**Objective:** To plot a standard curve for substrate used in protease assay. 

**Materials**

* Tris-HCl stock buffer solution (Tris-HCl, 1M, pH 8.5)
* 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) stock solution (20,000 uM)
* 384 well black plate
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips  
* Microcentrifuge tube/PCR tube
* Waste beaker 
* DMSO 

**Procedure**

#. Prepare working buffer from stock buffer by adding 1 mL of stock buffer solution into 4 mL of distilled water, resulting in 200 mM of Tris-HCl buffer of pH 8.5.
#. Do 6 to 7 times of 2 fold serial dilution of AMC stock using 100% DMSO in microcentrifuge tube/PCR tube. 
#. Add 38 uL of Tris-HCl working buffer into 384 well black plate according to number of concentrations of AMC to be tested. 
#. Add 2 uL of each concentration of serial diluted AMC into designated wells. Mix well by repeat pipetting. 
#. Read plate at 350 nm for excitation and 440 nm for emission every 10 mins for a duration of 60 mins. 

**Results** 

* Graph can be plotted using GraphPad Prism. 
* The graph plotted should be linear. 
* Use simple linear regression model to fit the line of best fit into the data points.
