Virus stock infection
=====================

To propagate virus stock for virus related experiments. Something like subculture for virus.

Requires

* 2% DMEM

**Procedure**

Assume we are culturing in a T25 culture flask.

#. Culture cells to about 70% confluency.
#. Remove existing media from culture flask. 
#. Add 5ml of new 2% DMEM into culture flask.
#. Thaw virus stock in water bath at 37 C. 
#. Add 500 uL of virus stock into culture flask.

    There are no fix volume of virus requires. If you already used 50 uL for other experiments like plaque assay, just transfer the remaining 450 uL into the culture flask. 

#. Incubate at 37 C.
#. Monitor daily under microscope for CPE formation and detachment of cells.
#. When 90% of the cells detached, the virus is ready for harvest. 

*Note: Dengue virus usually causes the cells to exhibits cytopathic effect (CPE) in 24 hrs. At 48 hrs, most cells should be dead and detached from the base of the flask. You can wait another day (at 72 hrs) to harvest the virus, but don't leave it too long (more than 3 days) in the incubator, there is a very high chance of bacterial contamination.*
