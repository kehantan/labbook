Enzyme progress curve
=====================

**Materials** 

* Tris-HCl stock buffer (1M, pH 8.5)
* Purified protease (with known concentrations in ug/mL or uM) 
* MCA substrate stock solution (10 mM)
* DMSO
* 384 well black plate 
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips
* Microcentrifuge tube/PCR tube 

**Procedure**

*Assay buffer*

#. Add 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl stock buffer solution into 4 mL of distilled water to obtain 200 mM of Tris-HCl assay buffer solution at pH 8.5. 

    * Adjust the volume if necessary. The ratio of 1 M Tris-HCl to distilled water needed is 1:4 to make 200 mM Tris-HCl

#. Mix well. Vortex if necessary. 
#. Leave at bench for later use. 

*Protease dilution*

#. Retrive purified protease from -80 C and thaw at room temperature. 
#. Calculate volume of enzyme stock to be added into each well. 
#. Add appropriate volume of enzyme into each well in a 384 well plate. 

    * Enzyme concentration: 20, 15, 10, 5 uM 

#. Top up each well with assay buffer until 36 uL. 

*Substrate serial dilution*

#. Prepare 6 microcentrifuge tubes. 
#. Add 112.5 uL of assay buffer into first tube. 
#. Add 50 uL of assay buffer into remaining tubes. 
#. Add 37.5 uL of substrate stock into first tube (2,500 uM, 150 uL).
#. Transfer 75 uL of mixture from first tube to second tube, mix well by repeat pipetting. Transfer 75 uL of mixture from second tube to third tube, mix well by repeat pipetting. Repeat this step until the last tube. 
#. Add 4 uL of substrate into corresponding wells. 
#. Add 40 uL of assay buffer into empty wells as blank. 

Optional: Split substrate into smaller volume (10 uL) for each concentration before added into 384 well plate to prevent cross contamination.
