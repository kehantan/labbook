Tris-HCl stock solution
=======================

* Tris-HCl stock solution, 1 :math:`M`, :math:`pH` 7.5
* Tris-HCl MW: 157.6 :math:`g/mol` 


Requires

* Tris-HCl powder 
* Distilled water/Milli-Q water
* Empty 1 :math:`L` bottle 
* Vacuum filter cup with 0.22 :math:`\mu m` filter
* Vacuum pump
* Magnetic stirrer
* 1 :math:`M` NaOH

*Note:* After some trial and eror, it was found that it takes a large volume of 1 :math:`M` NaOH to raise the :math:`pH` to 7.5, so can try use 2 :math:`M` or even 3 :math:`M` NaOH.


**Procedure**

#. Dissolve 157.6 :math:`g` of Tris-HCl powder in 900 :math:`mL` of distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Stir with a magnetic stirrer until all Tris-HCl powder dissolved. 
#. Adjust :math:`pH` to 7.5 with 1 :math:`M` NaOH.

    Or adjust to any other :math:`pH` you need, e.g.: 8.0, 8.5, etc.

#. Top up volume to 1 :math:`L` with distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Filter with vacuum filter cup into a new 1 :math:`L` bottle. 
#. Label the bottle. 

    Label example: :code:`Tris-HCl pH 7.5, name initials, date prepared`

#. Seal the bottle with parafilm and store in 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C. 

*Vacuum filter is a faster way to sterilise the buffer. Based on google search, there are no problem autoclaving Tris-HCl solution.*
