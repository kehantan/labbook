DMEM
=====

* In this lab, we prepare 1 L of DMEM from powder. We then aliquote from 1 L of DMEM to smaller vial and mix with FBS and Pen-Strep to make complete DMEM. 
* Read the packaging or search the data sheet online before preparing DMEM. Because at different times we might order different brands of DMEM powder and different manufacturer would left out different ingredients such as sodium bicarbonate, pyruvate, or HEPES. We need to measure the amount of the missing ingredients and manually add them when preparing the media. 


**Requires**

* Autoclaved Milli-Q water (1 L)
* Vacuum filter cup with 0.22 um filter 
* DMEM powder
* Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)
* Magnetic stirrer
* Autoclaved empty bottle (1 L)
* Vacumm pump


**Procedure**

#. Weight 3.7 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) as per instruction stated in `Thermo Fisher Scientific website <https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/12100046?SID=srch-srp-12100046>`_.

    * The website states the concentration of NaHCO3 should be 3.7 g/L
    * Refer to other website if the DMEM powder is from another manufacturer.

#. Open DMEM powder and decant whole packet into autoclaved Milli-Q water.
#. Clean magnetic stirring bar with 70% ethanol. Drop into the bottle.
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until DMEM powder completely dissolve in the Milli-Q water.
#. Add sodium bicarbonate into DMEM.  
#. Filter DMEM into new 1 L autoclaved empty bottle.
#. Seal the bottle with parafilm and store in fridge (4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C).


* Common concentrations of HEPES used in cell culture media is 25 mM. 
* Common concentrations of pyruvate used in cell culture media is 1 mM, 110 mg/L.
