LB agar
=======

* To prepare LB agar, follow the instructions on the LB agar bottle. 
* This procedure can be carried out on lab bench.
* If there are already extra agar plates prepared then this step can be skipped, but check the plates before use. Do not use contaminated agar plates or avoid using agar plates with water vapour condensation inside.  

**Materials** 

* LB agar powder 
* Petri dish 
* Schott bottle (500 mL)
* Spatula
* Weighting scale 
* Weighting boat
* Distilled water 
* Autoclave
* :ref:`Kanamycin (30 mg/mL) <kanamycin>` 
* Bunsen burner
* Lighter 
* Measuring cylinder

**Procedure**

#. In a 500 mL bottle, dissolve 9.25 g of LB powder in 250 mL distilled water. 
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until powder completely dissolve. 
#. Autoclave.

    * Set the autoclave mode to 'warm' instead or 'normal'. This would keep the agar at 60 C after autoclave is complete so the interior of autoclave would not cool to room temp and causes the agar to solidifies. 

#. Thaw Kanamycin from freezer in water bath. 
#. Add Kanamycin stock solution into LB agar after it cools to temperature that can be handled safely (~50-60 C). Final concentration of Kanamycin = 30 ug/mL.
#. Swirl the bottle to mix the Kanamycin well. 
#. Pour agar into petri dish. 
#. Wait until agar is cooled down and solidifies, label the plate, then wrap in plastic bag and store on bench or in 4 C. 

**Note:**

* Depends on how many plates to pour, 1 petri dish usually fits around 25 mL of agar, so 250 mL of agar would be enough for around 10 petri dish. If not that many agar plate is needed, can reduce the volume of agar, or can store extra plates on bench or in 4 C. 
* Using larger bottle because when agar boils it would create a lot of bubble. Larger bottle prevents the bubbling agar from overflow and clog the autoclave.
