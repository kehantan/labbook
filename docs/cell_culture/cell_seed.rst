Cell seeding
============

Cell seeding simply means we place the cell into the container we want the cells to grow (well plate, culture flask, etc.). 

The number of cells to seed depends on several factors: 

* the container we wanted to seed
* the type of experiments we wanted to conduct
* the day we wanted to conduct the experiment from the day we seed the cells. 

    Example: Due to scheduling reasons, we might want to seed the cells on Monday, but we only want to conduct the experiment on the cells on Wednesday. 

Although I would suggest seed the cells one day before your actual experiments whenever possible. 

**Some seeding values we used in our lab**

For MTT assay:

* Experiment on next day - 1,500 cells/well 

For plaque assay: 

* Experiment on next day - 600,000 cells/well 
* Experiment after 2 day - 400,000 cells/well
