MTT assay
=========

Before seeding
--------------
Count the theoretical cells required before start seeding. 

I usually seed 1,500 cells/well and 100 uL of media/well.

Assume we do 7 concentrations (including negatice control), then total cells needed = 7 concentrations x 5 wells/concentration x 1,500 cells/well = 52,500 cells 

After the cell counting step, double check if the cell required is sufficient for seeding. 

Seeding
-------
#. Trypsinise cells from culture flask.
#. Count the cells. Cross check if the cells required is sufficient. 
#. Calculate how much media required.
    
    Assume: 7 concentrations x 5 wells/concentration x 100 uL complete DMEM/well = 3,500 uL

#. Aspirate required number of cells and mix with required amount of media.
#. Seed cells in 96 well plate. 
#. Incubate the seeded 96 well plate for 24 hrs. 

Treatment
---------
#. Prepare different concentration of compound by diluting the compound in complete DMEM.

    Prepare 600 uL, 100 uL for each well, total of 5 well per concentration. 

#. Remove media from 96 well plate. 
#. Dispense 100 uL of complete DMEM in blank and control wells. 
#. Dispense 100 uL of compound diluted in complete DMEM into respective wells. 
#. Incubate for 48 hrs. 

MTT
---
#. Add 10 uL of MTT into each well.
#. Incubate for 3 hrs at 37C, 5% CO2.
#. Remove media. 
#. Add 100 uL of DMSO into each well. 
#. Place 96 well plate on shaker, shake for 1 hr.
#. Read absorbance. 

Read absorbance
---------------
#. Read plate at 570 nm.
