MTT working solution
====================

* MTT comes in powder form. 
* Concentration we use in this lab, 5 mg/mL. We usually prepare 10 ml in 15 ml centrifuge tube and store in freezer (-20 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C).
* MTT stock solution can be prepared on bench. 
* MTT solution is sensitive to light. So we need to wrap the prepared solution in aluminium foil. 


Requires

* MTT powder 
* Distilled water 
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Syringe
* Syringe filter (0.22 :math:`\mu`\ m)
* Aluminium foil


**Procedure**

#. Weight 0.05 g (50 mg) of MTT powder and transfer into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Add 10 mL of distilled water in to the centrifuge tube. 
#. Shake or vortex until dissolve. 
#. Filter with syringe filter. 

    Usually the powder would not dissolve completely, leaving behing some small chunks of precipitate. That is why filter required. 

#. Wrap the centrifuge tube with aluminium foil. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube.
