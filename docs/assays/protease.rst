Protease assay
==============

Reference for protease assay protocol: :cite:p:`ihssen_fluorogenic_2021`. 
There are several standard curve that need to be plotted before we carry out protease assay with the compounds that we wanted to test.  

* Protease activity 
* Substrate standard curve 

**Requires**

* Buffer
* Standard substrate
* DMSO 
* Microcentrifuge tube 

**Procedure**

#. Prepare substrate standard
