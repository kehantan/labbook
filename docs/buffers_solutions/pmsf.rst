PMSF stock
==========

* 0.2 M PMSF
* This stock solution can be prepared on bench.
* Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) stock was used to prepare lysis buffer for protein purification. 
* PMSF is not soluble in water, so have to use isopropyl alcohol. 

**Requires**

* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Isopropyl alcohol
* PMSF powder
* Syringe
* 0.22 um syringe filter 

**Procedure**

#. Dissolve 0.3484 g of PMSF powder in 5 mL of isopropyl alcohol. Vortex if necessary. 
#. Top up the solution with isopropyl alcohol until final volume of 10 mL. 
#. Filter with syringe filter (0.22 um). 
#. Label and store in freezer (-20 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C). 

* It is best to prepare PMSF before use as it could take some time for the crystals to dissolve completely. 
* Store in freezer (-20 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C).
* While the PMSF starts to thaw from freeze, there will be small crystals floating around. Let the PMSF reach room temperature and the crystals will reduce or dissolve completely again.
