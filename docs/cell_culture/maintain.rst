Standard passaging (subculture) 
===============================

**Objective:** Maintain cells in incubator.  

* This protocol uses Vero cells as an example.
* The general protocol for cell culture can be found in :footcite:t:`phelan2007techniques`. 
* Protocol for maintenance of Vero cells specifically can be found in :footcite:t:`ammerman2008growth`. 
* In our lab, we usually maintain the passage of cells between 15 to 35. 

**Materials**

* :ref:`Complete DMEM <10 dmem>`
* :ref:`Phosphate buffer saline (1x PBS) <pbs>`
* TrypLE
* Culture flask (T25/T75)
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Trypan blue
* 96 well plate (for mixing trypan blue and cell suspension for counting
* Cell counter
* Cell counting chamber
* Micropipette 
* Pipette tips
* Pipette gun 
* Waste beaker 
* Serological pipette 
* Rack 

**Procedure**

**Trypsinise** 

Refer to :ref:`trypsinise <My target>`

**Cell counting**

Refer to :ref:`cell count <cell count>` 

Cell counting is optional if you are just subculturing cells. For subculture, you can either: 

* Count the cells and seed the exact number of cells you want; OR 
* To save some work, you can just split the previous culture into different portions depending on the percentage of confluency you need for your experiments and the days you want to conduct the experiments. 

    * Example: You have 1 mL of cell suspension after trypsinisation. To split 1:3, put around 300 uL of cell suspension into new culture flask with complete DMEM. You can also use other ratio like 1:5 or 1:10 split. To get the correct confluency using splitting by ratio method requires some trial and error and some experience. 

**Cell seeding**

#. Add appropriate amount of complete DMEM into new culturing flask. T25 = 5 mL, T75 = 9 mL. 
#. Seed cells onto a new flask at the desired cell density.

    * If you want to seed a specific number of cells, you will have to do cell count beforehand. If you wanted to split by ratio, just transfer the amount of cell suspension based on the split ratio into the new flask. 

#. Tilt the culture flask to evenly distribute the seeded cells. 
#. Label the flask. 

    * Label example: cell type, passage number, date, name initials

#. Incubate. 37 C, 5% CO2.

**Numbers of cells to seed in flask**

This is just a guideline based on the cell line I worked with, Vero cells. The actual duplication speed of cells can be subjected to various factors like: cell line, cell condition, passage number, growth environment, etc. 

In a T25 culture flask, to reach around 80% cell confluency in:

* next day, we will can seed about 800,000 cells
* 3 days, we can seed about 500,000 cells
* 7 days, we can seed about 25,000 cells

In a T75 culture flask, to reach around 80% cell confluency in:

* next day, we can seed about 1,500,000 cells 
* 3 days, we can to seed about 800,000 cells
* 7 days, we can seed about 50,000 cells
