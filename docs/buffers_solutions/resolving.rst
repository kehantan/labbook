Resolving buffer
================

**Objective:** To prepare Tris-HCl buffer for casting resolving gel. 
 
* Concentration = 1.5 M, Volume = 150 mL, pH = 8.8 
* Tris MW = 121.14 g/mol

**Materials** 

* Tris base
* Distilled water 
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips 
* Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 6 N)
* Magnetic stirrer
* Bottle
* Weighing balance 
* Spatula
* Weighing boat
* pH meter 
* Waste beaker 

**Procedure** 

#. Add 27.23 g of Tris base into 70-90 mL of distilled water. 

    * 1 M = 121.14 g/L; 1.5 M = 181.71 g/L = 27.2565 g/150 mL

#. Stir untill Tris base powder completely dissolved. 
#. Adjust pH to 8.8 with 6 N HCl.
#. Top up with distilled water untill 150 mL. 
#. Label and store at 4 C.
