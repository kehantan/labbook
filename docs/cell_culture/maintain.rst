Optional: 

* Trypan blue
* 96 well plate (for mixing trypan blue and cell suspension for counting)
* Cell counter

Procedure
---------

Trypsinise
~~~~~~~~~~
#. Remove media.
#. Wash cells with calcium- and magnesium-free balanced salt solution, phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
#. Add appropriate amount of detaching agent, TrypLE. 

    Depends on the flask size, usually I would use 600 uL for T25 flask and 1000 uL for T75 flask. Just need to make sure TrypLE is sufficeint to cover the surface of the flask.

#. Incubate at 37Â°C until cells are fully detached from culture flask

    Usually we do <5 min, not more than 10 min. 

#. Tap the culture flask slightly to mechanically detach the cells from the flask. 
#. Neutralising the TrypLE with complete DMEM by pipetting complete DMEM into the culturing flask.

    If trypsinise with 600 uL of TrypLE, then insert 600 uL of complete DMEM
    
    You can flush the base of culture flask with the complete DMEM + TrypLE mixture to further detach and collect more cells. 

#. Transfer the cell suspension from culturing flask to 15 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge for 5 mins at 1500 rpm. 
#. Dispose the supernatant with micropipette.

    You can also use serological pipette to remove the supernatant, but be more cautious as the pipette gun have greater suction power, you don't want your cell pellet to be sucked away. 

#. Leave minimal amount of liquid in the centrifuge tube. 
#. Resuspend the cell pellet (sediment) in complete DMEM, pipette repeatedly to break the cell pellet.

    For optimal number of cells to ease the counting work, I would usually resuspend cell pellet obtained from T25 flask in 1 ml of complete DMEM; and cell pellet obtained from T75 flask in 3 ml of complete DMEM. 
    
    Sometimes there could be a larger amount of cells (e.g.: >90% confluency), which I would add more complete DMEM. For example, resuspend cell pellet obtained from T25 in 2 ml of complete DMEM. 


Cell counting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This step is optional. To save some work, you can just split the previous culture into different number of portions depending on the percentage of confluency you need for your experiments and the days you want to conduct the experiments. Or you can count the cells and seed the exact number of cells you want. 


Cell seeding
~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Place appropriate amount of complete DMEM into new culturing flask.

    T25 = 5 ml 
    
    T75 = 9 ml

#. Plate cells onto a new flask at the desired cell density.
#. Swirl flask to evenly distribute the seeded cells. 
#. Incubate. 37C, 5% CO2.

Numbers of cells to seed in flask
---------------------------------
T25, to 80% confluency in...

* Next day = 800,000 cells
* 3 days = 500,000 cells
* Next week = 25,000 cells

T75, to 80% confluency in...

* Next day = 1,000,000 cells 
* 3 days = 500,000 cells
* Next week = 50,000 cells
