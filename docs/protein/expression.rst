Protein expression
==================

* This procedure has to be carried out in laminar flow. 
* Do not use the laminar flow in cell culture room, as it could result in contamination. 
* Remember to plan experiments ahead and book laminar flow and orbital shaker for bacteria work.


**Requires**

* Transformed BL21
* BL21 cell + Plasmid
* :ref:`IPTG stock solution <iptg>`


**Procedure**

Prepare LB agar
---------------

* LB agar was used for culture of the transformed BL21 bacteria. 
* To prepare LB agar, just follow the instructions on the LB agar bottle. 


#. Dissolve powder in 250 mL distilled water. 
#. Dispense 25 uL of Kanamycin stock solution into LB agar solution.
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until powder completely dissolve. 
#. Autoclave.

    Recommend: Set the autoclave mode to 'warm' instead or 'normal'. This would keep the agar at 60 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C after autoclave is complete so the agar would not solidifies. 

#. Pour agar into petri dish. 

    If the autoclave mode was set to 'normal', remove the agar from autoclave as soon as possible and pour into petri dish to prevents the agar from solidifies in the flask/bottle.

#. Wrap in plastic bag and store on bench. 


Prepare LB broth
----------------

To prepare LB broth, just follow the instructions on the LB broth bottle.

#. Dissolve powder in 500 mL distilled water, in Erlenmeyer flask. 
#. Dispense 1 mL of Kanamycin stock solution (300 mg/mL) into LB broth. 
#. Cover flask with aluminium foil, tighten with rubber band, and store on bench. 
  
    To reduce risk of contamination, can use 2 L bottle. 

For the ease of work, aside from preparing a 1 L LB broth for large scale culture, we can also prepare another LB broth in a 500 mL bottle used for various purpose such as small scale culture (initial culture of BL21 bacterial in 15 mL centrifuge tube before transfer to the 1 L broth) and as a blank for measuring the OD of the cultured bacteria. 


Subculture E. coli
------------------

**Requires**

* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Transformed *E. coli* cultured on plate 
* Plastic inoculation loop
* Bunsen burner


#. Aliquote 2 x 10 mL from 1 L LB broth into seperate 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Aliquote 5 mL of broth into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 

    To be used as blank for later experiments.

#. Pick a single *E. coli* colony from agar plate and mix with LB broth in the 15 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Pick a single *E. coli* colony from agar plate and streak on new LB agar plate. 
#. Shake the centrifuge tube. 24 hrs, 37 :math:`^{\circ} C`, 180 rpm.


Large scale culture
-------------------

**Requires**

* Spectrophotometer
* 2 L Erlenmeyer flask
* 2 L orbital shaker
* :ref:`IPTG stock solution <iptg>`
* Refrigerated centrifuge 


#. Decant the 2 15 mL centrifuge tube culture into the 1 L LB broth. 
#. Shake. 1 to 3 hrs, 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, 180 rpm. 
#. Check OD at 600 nm. 

    Previous step mentioned shake for 1 to 3 hours, but check OD every hour to make sure the reading falls around 0.5.

    Access to spectrophotometer: Faculty of Pharmacy.

#. Add 1 mL IPTG (50 mM) to the 1 L LB broth culture. 
#. Shake. 2 hrs, 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, 180 rpm.
#. Centrifuge. 3000 rpm, 10 mins. 

    Centrifuge with the chiller centrifuge in Bilik Kultur Tisu. Each bucket can hold 1 50 mL centrifuge tube. 

    Remember to book the machine before use, and pre-cool at least 20 mins before use 

#. Decant supernatant. 
#. Wash pellet with PBS. 

    Although there are no problem using PBS for cell culture, it is best to prepare another PBS for bacteria work to reduce possibilities of contamination. 

#. Transfer suspension into 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 
#. Decant supernatant. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube.
#. Store pellet at -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C.

    Bacterial pellet can be stored in -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C for months wihtout problem. 

    Wrap the centrifuge tube in plastic bag before storing in -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C to prevent contamination of other samples.
