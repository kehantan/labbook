Cell seeding
============

**Objective:** Seed cells for further experiments.

Cell seeding simply means placing the cell into the container we want the cells to grow (well plate, culture flask, etc.) for further experiments or maintaining the cell lines. 

The number of cells to seed depends on several factors: 

* the container we wanted to seed (T25, T75, 96 well plate, etc.)
* the type of experiments we wanted to conduct (MTT, plaque assay, etc.)
* the day we wanted to conduct the experiment from the day we seed the cells. 

    Example: Due to scheduling reasons, we might want to seed the cells on Monday, but we only want to conduct the experiment on the cells on Wednesday. Although I would suggest to always seed the cells one day before your actual experiments whenever possible. 

**Some cell seeding values we used in our lab for Vero cells**

For MTT assay:

* Experiment on next day where the cells confluency is around 70% = 5,000 cells/well 

For plaque assay on a 6 well plate: 

* Experiment on next day where cells confluency is around 90% = 600,000 cells/well 
* Experiment after 2 day where cells confluency is around 90% = 400,000 cells/well 

For plaque assay on a 12 well plate:

* Experiment on next day where cells confluency is around 90% = 200,000 cells/well 

For antiviral assay on a 12 well plate: 
* Experiment on next day where cells confluency is around 70% = 150,000 cells/well 

The number of cells to seed depending heavily on the types of cells you are working with because different cells have different growth rate. For example, cancer cell lines usually have faster growth rate compared to normal cell lines. I would suggest you to do a growth curve to determine the growth rate of the cells so you can get a good idea of how many cells you have to seed.
