.. _agarose:

5% agarose (w/v)
================

**Objective:** To prepare 5% agarose for plaque assay use. 

**Requires**

* Agarose powder
* Milli-Q water/distilled water
* Empty bottle (50 mL)
 
**Procedure**

#. Add 5 g of agarose powder into 100 mL distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Swirl the bottle slowly to dissolve as much agarose powder as possible in the distilled water. 

    * It is normal if the agarose + distilled water mixture looks cloudy.

#. Loosen the cap of the bottle and put the bottle into the microwave oven. 
#. Turn on the microwave oven and observe the agarose powder + distilled water mixture. 

    * Bubbles will formed once the water was heated up. Let the mixture bubbles for 1 to 2 mins.
    * Turn off the microwave oven if the mixture bubbles too vigorously to prevent spillage in the oven.
    * After the bubbles settles down, heat again. Repeat until the mixture turns into clear and colourless. 

#. Remove the bottle from microwave oven and leave it on bench to cool. 

    * Beware that the bottle is very hot at this state. Wear protection before removing the bottle from microwave oven. 

#. Label.

    Label example: :code:`5% Agarose, name initials, date prepared`

#. Agarose can be stored on bench.
