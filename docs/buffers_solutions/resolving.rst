Resolving buffer
================

**Objective:** To prepare Tris-HCl buffer for casting resolving gel. 

* Concentration = 1.5 M, Volume = 100 mL, pH = 8.8 
* Tris-HCl MW = 157.6 g/mol

**Materials** 

* Tris-HCl
* Distilled water 
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips 
* :ref:`Sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) <naoh>`
* Magnetic stirrer
* Bottle
* Spatula 
* Weighing boat

**Procedure** 

#. Add 23.64 g of Tris-HCl into 50-70 mL of distilled water. 

    * 1 M = 157.6 g/L; 1.5 M = 236.4 g/L = 23.64 g/100 mL

#. Stir untill Tris-HCl powder completely dissolved. 
#. Adjust pH to 8.8 with NaOH.
#. Top up with distilled water untill 100 mL. 
#. Label and store at 4 C.
