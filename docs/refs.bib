	abstract = {This protocol describes an in vitro fluorogenic assay to measure the proteolytic activity and identify inhibitors of Mpro, the main protease produced by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Studies to identify potential inhibitors of Mpro mainly rely on in silico molecular dynamics simulations or on FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) substrates. The protocol is based on an aminomethyl coumarin substrate. High sensitivity, specificity, and an easily detectable fluorescent read-out are the advantages offered by this rapid assay, which allows high throughput screening of new Mpro inhibitors.},

	abstract = {Determination of microgram quantities of protein in the Bradford Coomassie brilliant blue assay is accomplished by measurement of absorbance at 590 nm. This most common assay enables rapid and simple protein quantification in cell lysates, cellular fractions, or recombinant protein samples, for the purpose of normalization of biochemical measurements. However, an intrinsic nonlinearity compromises the sensitivity and accuracy of this method. It is shown that under standard assay conditions, the ratio of the absorbance measurements at 590 nm and 450 nm is strictly linear with protein concentration. This simple procedure increases the accuracy and improves the sensitivity of the assay about 10-fold, permitting quantification down to 50 ng of bovine serum albumin. Furthermore, the interference commonly introduced by detergents that are used to create the cell lysates is greatly reduced by the new protocol. A linear equation developed on the basis of mass action and Beer's law perfectly fits the experimental data.},
