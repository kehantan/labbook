DMEM
=====

**Objective:** To prepare DMEM solution from DMEM powder. 

* Est. preparation time = 1 hr
* Read the packaging or search the data sheet online before preparing DMEM. Because at different times we might order different brands of DMEM powder and different manufacturer would left out different ingredients such as sodium bicarbonate or HEPES. We need to measure the amount of the missing ingredients and manually add them when preparing the media. 
* DMEM can be prepared on bench, but filter in BSC. 

**Materials**

* Autoclaved Milli-Q water (1 L)
* Autoclaved empty bottle (1 L)
* Vacuum filter cup, 0.22 um pore size 
* DMEM powder
* Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)
* Magnetic stirrer
* Vacumm pump
* HEPES
* Weighing balance 
* Weighing boat 
* Spatula 

**Procedure**

#. Add 13.535 g of DMEM powder into 1 L autoclaved Milli-Q water.
#. Clean magnetic stirring bar with 70% ethanol then drop into the bottle.
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until DMEM powder completely dissolve in the Milli-Q water.
#. Add 3.7g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) into DMEM.  
#. Add 6 g of HEPES in to the DMEM solution. 

    * Final concentration = 25 mM or 6g/L of DMEM. 

#. Filter DMEM into new 1 L autoclaved empty bottle using cup filter inside a biosafety cabinet. 
#. Label.
#. Seal the bottle with parafilm and store in 4 C.
