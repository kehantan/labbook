Bradford assay
==============

**Objective:** To quantify concentration of protein in a sample.

**Requires**

* Microcentrifuge tube
* Distilled water or PBS
* Bovine serum albumin (BSA)
* Bradford reagent 
* 96 well plate, clear
* Microplate reader 
  
**Procedure**

#. Dilute BSA powder in distilled water to make stock solution of BSA. 
#. Prepare a series of BSA standard solutions of known concentrations (e.g. 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mg/mL) by diluting the BSA stock solution in distilled water.
#. Prepare protein sample, with and without dilution.

    I usually do 1/2 fold serial dilution. 

#. In a clear 96 well plate, add 10 uL of BSA or protein sample into 190 uL of Bradford reagent. Mix well by repeat pipetting.  
#. Incubated at room temperature, 5 mins.
#. Read absorbance at 595 nm and 490 nm.
