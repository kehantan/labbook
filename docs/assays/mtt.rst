MTT assay
=========


Seeding
-------
#. Trypsinise cells from culture flask.
#. Count the cells.
#. Calculate how many cells and media required. 
#. Aspirate required number of cells and mix with required amount of media. 
#. Seed cells in 96 well plate. 

    1,500 cells in each well for next day treatment in a 96 well plate.
    
#. Incubate the seeded 96 well plate for 24 hrs. 

Treatment
---------
#. Treat the cells with compound with different dilutions. 
#. Prepare different concentration of compound by diluting in complete DMEM.

    Prepare 600 uL, 100 uL for each well, total of 5 well per concentration. 

#. Remove media from 96 well plate. 
#. Dispense 100 uL of complete DMEM in blank and control wells. 
#. Dispense 100 uL of compound diluted in complete DMEM into respective wells. 
#. Incubate for 48 hrs. 

MTT
---
#. Add 10 uL of MTT into each well.
#. Incubate for 3 hrs at 37C, 5% CO2.
#. Remove media. 
#. Add 100 uL of DMSO into each well. 
#. Place 96 well plate on shaker, shake for 1 hr.
#. Read absorbance. 

Read absorbance
---------------
#. Read plate at 570 nm.
