Buffer D
========
The final condition of Buffer D should be 

* 100 mM Tris-HCl
* pH 7.5
* 300 mM NaCl

Requires
--------
* Tris-HCl
* NaCl
* Distilled water/Milli-Q water
* Vacuum filter cup with 0.22 Âµm filter
* 1 L bottle
* 1 M NaOH 

Procedure
---------

Prepare stock Tris-HCl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Preparing 1 L of stock Tris-HCl, with concentration of 1 M, and pH adjusted to 7.5

#. Measure 157.6 g of Tris-HCl into 1 L empty bottle.
#. Add 900 ml of distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Adjust Tris-HCl solution to pH to 7.5 with 1 M NaOH. 
#. Top up to 1 L with distilled water/Milli-Q water. 

Prepare Buffer D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Add 400 ml of 1M stock Tris-HCl into a 1 L empty bottle.
#. Add 70.12 g of NaCl into the same bottle. 
#. Top up to total volume of 1 L with distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Stir until NaCl completely dissolved. 
#. Filter with vacuum filter cup with 0.22 um filter into a new 1 L bottle.
#. Seal with parafilm and store in 4 C if not used immediately.
