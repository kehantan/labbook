Make bacteria culture glycerol stock
====================================

**Objective:** To make bacteria glycerol stock 

* Bacteria glycerol stock is for long term storage 
* Schematics for making bacteria glycerol stock can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17MrwEkPY6BbYUZrCteCmLGkgHx3DN52Zq91Yix2CnXw/edit?usp=sharing>`_

**Materials**

* Overnight culture of transformed *E.coli* culture
* Inoculating loop
* Bunsen burner 
* Lighter/Matchsticks
* Cryovial/Microcentrifuge tube/Eppendorf tube
* Glycerol stock solution (50%-80%)
* Tube rack

*Note:* Eppendorf tube can be used, but not recommended, because it is not secure and might opened up in -80 C freezer. 

**Procedure**

#. Set up bench for bacteria work.
#. Take overnight transformed E.coli culture from incubator.
#. Add 500 uL of 50% glycerol into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
#. Take a loopful of bacteria colonies with an inoculating loop.
#. Add the bacteria colonies into the glycerol. Make sure the colonies resuspend completely in the glycerol, vortex if necessary.#. Label the tubes.
#. Store the bacteria glycerol stock in -80 C.
