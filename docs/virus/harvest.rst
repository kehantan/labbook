Harvest virus stock
===================

Harvesting virus. It as basically subculture for virus.  

Requires 
--------
* 15 ml Centrifuge tube 
* Microcentrifuge tube 

Procedure
---------

Assume the culture is in a T25 culture flask. 

#. Transfer media that contain dead cells and virus into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 mins. 
#. Aliquote the supernatant into multiple microcentrifuge tube, 500 uL of supernatant in each tube.

    In a T25 culture flask with 5 ml of 2% DMEM, it should be enough for 10 microcentrifuge tube. 

    Be careful when aliquote to not disturb the sediments. 

#. Snap freezing the microcentrifuge tube by submerge into liquid nitrogen. 
#. Store the snap frozen microcentrifuge tube in -80 C. 

The harvested virus stock need to have its virus titer quantified. We do this by using plaque assay.
