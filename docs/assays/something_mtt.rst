Something about MTT assay
=========================

MTT assay is a very common assay, you can find a lot of published articles that optimised MTT assays for different purposes. You don't have to strictly follow the parameters in this protocol. The parameters used in this protocol are the ones that is good enough for my experiments. If you are using other cell lines, refer to other sources for different parameters. 

Some important parameters to take note of including: 

    * Number of cells to seed in each well 
    * the amount of reagent to use (PBS, trypsin, DMEM, DMSO, MTT, etc.)
    * time of incubation (12, 24, 36, 48 hrs, etc.) 

There are some parameters that you will need to find out before starting MTT assay. Some common questions you will immediately encounter when you first trying to do MTT assay including:

#. *How many cells to seed in each well?*

    * The common approach is to refer to the published research articles related to the cell lines you are working with to get an idea on how many cells you should seed. 
    * If you cannot get the information you can do some optimisation yourself by trying out any range between 1,000 to 50,000 cells/well. 
    
#. *How many different concentrations you wanted to test with your compound?*

    * Concentrations of compound to test depending on the solubility of the compound in DMSO or other solvent (like water), different compound has different solubility in DMSO. Even if the compound is completely soluble in DMSO, it may precipiate when attempt to dilute with DMEM during serial dilution. 
    * If you have no idea what compound concentrations to use, you can try out by using a larger range of concentrations first. 
    * I typically start with 200 ug/mL and half it for each dilution step (200, 100, 50 ug/mL, etc.). My rationale is that it is easier to find your compound's optimum concentration by screening it with a wider range. If you screen your compound at a narrower range like 20, 40, 60 ug/mL, etc., you might need to do more assays to find out the optimum concentration. So start from wider range, then narrow down if necessary. 

#. *Other common questions including 'How long I should incubate? How much MTT reagent I should use?'*

    * The list of questions are non-exhaustive and can be difficult answer as these parameters are related to multiple factors like what cell lines you are dealing with, what is the purpose of the experiments, etc. 
    * Fortunately, there are a lot of resources you can refer online, or you can simply ask around other lab members who had experience with cell lines that you are using. 
    * For most part, the parameters should be transferrable from one cell line to another. 

The whole MTT assay is a long procedure that can span multiple days. It takes 3 seperate days to complete 1 round of MTT. A typical MTT assay workflow would looks like this:

    * :ref:`Part 1 <mtt-part1>` - trypsinise, count, and seed cells in a 96 well plate 
    * :ref:`Part 2 <mtt-part2>` - treatment, meaning treating the cells with compounds
    * :ref:`Part 3 <mtt-part3>` - adding the MTT reagent to the well plates and read the absorbance

After completing 1 part, you might have to wait around 24 hrs or more to proceed to the next part. With this information you can plan your experiments accordingly (maybe you want to avoid coming on weekends, public holidays, etc.).
