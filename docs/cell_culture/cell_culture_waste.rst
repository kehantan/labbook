Cell culture waste
==================

This section is about cell culture waste, refer to :ref:`virus waste <virus waste>` if you are dealing with virus or any virus related work.

There are some department policy for waste management that our lab is required to follow. These rules might not always make sense, but it is here... 

    * for documentation purpose
    * at least you know such rule exists
    * as a respond to auditor

* There are specific beaker for cell culture waste. If you are doing cell related work, use the unlaballed waste beaker.
* Solid waste (pipette tips, culture flask, etc.) can be discarded into yellow bin in the lab after discarding the liquid waste into the sink. 
* Rinse the waste beaker with tap water and dry it on the rack beside the sink. 
* If you want to be really clean, can wash the waste beaker with Decon90. 


**REMEMBER!**

You don't have to follow the rules very strictly, but adhere to them whenever possible. 

For example, if someone already using the waste beaker for cell culture, you can always use the one labelled 'for virus use'. You don't have to wait for the other person to finish only proceed to use the waste beaker for cell culture work. 

It is always important to use common sense and logic when working in the lab.
