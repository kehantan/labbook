Protease activity assay
=======================

**Objective:** To quantify the activity of the purified protease. 

This step is required before we do protease inhibition assay with our compounds.  

Prepare stock solutions and buffers before we actually start the procedure, preferably one day before the experiment day. Usually the buffers and stock solutions can be stored in 4 C for future use. 

**Requires** 

* Buffer
* Purified protease
* MCA substrate
* Black 96 well plate 

**Procedure**

#. Purified protease is stored in -80 C. Thaw it before use.
#. Prepare different concentrations of protease. 
#. Add constant amount of substrate into protease. 
#. Incubate for 30 mins at 37 C. 
#. Read plate at 350 nm emission and 440 nm excitation.
