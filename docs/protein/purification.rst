Protein extraction and purification
===================================

**Objective:** To extract and purify expressed protein from bacteria. 

Buffers 
-------

* Prepare the buffers preferrably at least one day before use, because even though we are preparing from stock solution, weighing and stirring can take up significant amount time. Also, buffer D need to be pre-cooled in the cold room. 

**Lysis buffer**

* In this protocol, we need at least 25 mL of lysis buffer, so prepare around 30 mL should be sufficient for 1 round of purification. 
* It is best to prepare PMSF and lysozyme stock before use. By personal experience, storing PMSF and lysozyme stock in freezer for future use can have some detrimental effect on purification of protease.

**Buffer B**

* It's not strictly necessary, but it is best to prepare 2 buffer B: one for bench use, another to pre-cooled in cold room.

* The bacterial pellet from the end of :ref:`expression <protein-expression>` procedure was stored at -80 C. Extraction and purification would proceed from there.  

Protein extraction
------------------

Estimated time needed: 2 hr

**Materials**

* Ice box filled with ice
* Plastic bucket filled with ice 
* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 mL)
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL and 50 mL)
* Ni-NTA resin 
* Lysis buffer
* Buffer B
* Rotator
* Micropipette and tips (1000 uL)
* Waste beaker
* Paper towel
* Plastic beaker (10 mL)

**Procedure**

#. Retrieve the bacteria pellet from -80 C. 
#. Add 12.5 mL of lysis buffer into each centrifuge tube and resuspend the pellet completely. Mix with a vortex mixer. Use micropipette to break the pellet if necessary.  

    * It is normal for the suspension to become slimy when lysis buffer was added.

#. Combine the suspension of both tube into a single 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Leave the centrifuge tube at room temperature for 30 mins.

    * Optional: Rotate the centrifuge tube at 60 rpm with a rotator. 
    * Can :ref:`prepare Ni-NTA resin <resin_prep>` while waiting for the incubation. 

#. Prepare for sample homogenisation. Refer to :ref:`section below <homogenisation_prep>` for preparation of homogenisation procedure.
#. Pour suspension into small plastic beaker. Place the plastic beaker into ice. 
#. Homogenise the suspension using sonicator. 

    * Sonicator settings in Mol Med: output 10-20, duty cycle 70%, 2 sec on, 0.5 sec off, for 1-2 mins, on ice.   
    * Sonicator settings in FOP: Amp 35% (Max amp for probe is 40%, over 40% can risk breaking the probe), 2 sec on, 0.5 sec off, for 1-2 mins, on ice. 
    * Sonicate until the suspension form a layer of froth. If froth does not form, repeat the sets until the suspension froth. Wait 2-5 mins between sets to cool the suspension down, as high heat output from sonication may denature the proteins.  
    
#. Transfer the homogenised suspension into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 8000 rpm, 4 C, 15 mins.  

.. _homogenisation_prep:

**Preparation for homogenisation**

* Fill a bucket with ice (get ice from ice machine).  
* Look for a small plastic beaker which is 10 mL or 20 mL in volume under the 'glassware' cabinet. Otherwise, can use 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
* Use plastic beaker because the sonic pulse generated by homogeniser might break glass beaker. 
* Pour the suspension in the plastic beaker and submerge the beaker in ice bucket until silghtly below the lip of the beaker to maintain the suspension at low temperature throughout the sonication process.
* Because 25 mL of lysis buffer was added into the pellet and the small plastic beaker cannot contain all 25 mL of liquid at once, split the suspension into two portion and homogeinise seperately.

Protein purification
--------------------

.. _resin_prep:

**Preparation of Ni-NTA resin**

#. Mix the Ni-NTA solution well before use. 

    * Ni-NTA would form a thick gel-like layer at the bottom of the container if left standing.
    * Invert the container multiple times to resuspend the gel-like substance completely into the solution. Make sure no blue coloured gel like substance at the bottom of the bottle. 

#. Add 2.5 mL of Ni-NTA resin into 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 500 x g (or 3,000 rpm), 5 mins.
#. Remove supernatant.

    * The precipitate can easily resuspend into the solution with the slightest movement, remove supernatant slowly and with care. 

#. Resuspend pellet with 5 mL of Buffer B. 
#. Centrifuge. 500 x g (or 3,000 rpm), 5 min.
#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Keep the 50 mL centrifuge with Ni-NTA in ice until later use. 

**Protein purification from pellet (after lysis)**

#. Remove supernatant from the centrifuged tube.

    * Collect 100 uL of supernatant for SDS-PAGE later (**sample #0**)

#. Add 2 to 5 mL of Buffer B to the pellet and vortex to completely dissolve the pellet. 
#. Add Buffer B into the tube up to 24 mL of volume. 

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE later (**sample #1**)

#. Cool the sample on ice for 30 mins to 1 hr. 
#. Devide the suspensions into 24 microcentrifuge tubes (1 mL per microcentrifuge tube).
#. Centrifuge. 20,000 to 27,000 x g (or 15,000 rpm), 4 C, 10 mins. 
#. Collect supernatant.

    * Collect 100 uL of the collected supernatant for SDS-PAGE (**sample #2**)

#. Collect pellet. 

    * To make SDS-PAGE sample of pellet, add 1 mL of lysis buffer or Buffer B to pellet and mix using vortex. 
    * Leave the pellet on ice for 1 hr, then collect 100 uL of suspended pellet for SDS-PAGE (**sample #3**)

#. Add the collected supernatant to Ni-NTA resin

    * Store all pellet in their respective microcentrifuge tube at 4 C

#. Bring rotator into cold room. Rotate the Ni-NTA. 4 C, 30 mins to 1 hr.
#. Centrifuge. 500 x g (or 3000 rpm), 4 C, 5 mins. 
#. Remove supernatant.
    
    * Collect 100 uL of supernatant for SDS-PAGE (**sample #4**)

#. Add 10 mL Buffer B into the Ni-NTA resin and mix well. 
#. Centrifuge. 500 x g (or 3,000 rpm), 4 C, 5 mins.
#. Remove supernatant. 

    * Collect 100 uL of supernatant for SDS-PAGE (**sample #5**)

#. Transfer Ni-NTA resin to column using 10 mL of Buffer B. 
#. Collect flow through. 

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE (**sample #6**) 

#. Add 10 mL of Buffer B and collect the elution. 

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE (**sample #7**)

#. Add 2 mL of Buffer C and collect the elution. 

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE (**sample #8**)

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE (**sample #9-#12**)

#. Run SDS-PAGE for all 12 samples. 

SDS-PAGE for protein purification
---------------------------------

* Refer to :ref:`SDS-PAGE <sds-page>` for the protocol. 

Dialysis
--------

* This procedure needs to be carried out in cold room.
* Select 2 to 3 fractions containing the target protein based on the result from SDS-PAGE.

* Beaker (1 L)
* Magnetic stirrer
* Retort stand
* Syringe
* Needle 
* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 mL)

**Procedure** 

#. Pre-cool Buffer D to 4 C at least 30 mins before starting dialysis. 
#. Submerge the cassette in to Buffer D for 15 to 30 mins. 
#. Remove the cassette from the buffer. 
#. Using a syringe and needle, transfer the fractions from centrifuge tube into the cassette. 
#. Submerge the cassette into Buffer D. 
#. Leave the set up in the cold room for 1 hr. 
#. After 1 hr, change to fresh buffer D. Leave the set up for another 1 hr. 
#. After 1 hr, change to fresh buffer D. Leave the set up overnight.
