=========
This is a preparation upon Dr. Mori's request: 

* 100 mM Tris-HCl 
* pH 8.0
* 300 mM NaCl
* 6M Urea

Formula
g = M x L x MW

g = weight in grams; M = Molar; L = Water in Litres; MW = Molecular weight

Requires
--------
* Tris-HCl
* NaCl
* Urea

To make 250 ml of Buffer B:
---------------------------
#. Weight and place in an empty bottle. 

       * 90.06 g of urea
