Trypan blue
===========

**Objective:** To aliquot trypan blue solution into smaller vial. 

* Trypan blue comes as a stock solution in a bottle.
* Just aliquote into a smaller vial and it is ready to be used. 
* Because we usually do not use large amount of trypan blue, it should be sufficient to aliquote it into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
* Trypan blue can be stored at bench for future use. 
* It is not necessary to aliquote trypan blue in biosafety cabinet. 

**Requires**

* Trypan blue solution
* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 mL)

**Procedure**

#. Aliquote around 1 mL of trypan blue from the trypan blue stock solution into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Label the microcentrifuge tube. 

    Label example: :code:`Trypan blue, name initials`

#. Store at bench.
