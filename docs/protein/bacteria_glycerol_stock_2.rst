Make bacteria culture glycerol stock
====================================

* Bacteria glycerol stock is for long term storage 
* Schematics for making bacteria glycerol stock can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17MrwEkPY6BbYUZrCteCmLGkgHx3DN52Zq91Yix2CnXw/edit?usp=sharing>`_

Overnight bacteria culture in broth
-----------------------------------

**Materials** 

* Inoculating loop
* LB broth, autoclaved, Kanamycin added (30 - 50 ug/mL)   
* Centrifuge tube (50 mL)
* Bunsen burner 
* Lighter 
* Overnight culture of bacteria on LB agar plate 

**Procedure**

#. Set up a sterile bench for bacteria work. 
#. Add 5 mL of LB broth into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Pick a single colony from LB agar plate and mix to the LB broth inside the centrifuge tube. 
#. Incubate, 37 C, overnight. 

Bacteria glycerol stock
-----------------------

**Materials**

* Overnight culture of transformed bacteria cultured in LB broth
* Inoculating loop
* Bunsen burner 
* Lighter/Matchsticks
* Cryovial/Microcentrifuge tube/Eppendorf tube
* Glycerol stock solution (50%-80%), autoclaved
* Tube rack

*Note:* Eppendorf tube can be used, but not recommended, because it is not secure and might opened up in -80 C freezer. 

**Procedure**

#. Set up a sterile bench for bacteria work.
#. Add 500 uL of 50% glycerol into a cryovial. 
#. Take overnight bacteria culture from incubator.
#. Add 500 uL of the bacteria culture into the cryovial. Make sure the culture media and glycerol completely mixed.
#. Label the tubes and left the tubes on bench for about 30 mins. 
#. Store the bacteria glycerol stock in -80 C.
