Why do we need to purify protein in one day?

After 25 years and 180 proteins it has become clear to me that for some proteins even one extra day when they being kept under conditions normally used for protein purification could be critical in respect ot their activity and crystallization ability. Whilst the majority of proteins can survive long purification and can be kept and stored at 4 C for days and even weeks with little loss in activity, it does them no harm to be purified in one day either. To achieve the goal of complete protein purification in one day you should move fast and choose appropritate protocols, avoiding long procedures such as dialysis, long centrifugations and slow chromatography. Below are some protocols and tips which helps me to achieve this goal.
