Tris-HCl
========

**Objective:** To prepare Tris-HCL stock solution. 

* Concentration = 1 M, Volume = 1 L, adjusted pH.
* Tris-HCl MW: 157.6 g/mol 

**Materials**

* Tris-HCl powder 
* Distilled water
* Bottle 
* Magnetic stirrer
* 5 M NaOH or HCl depends on desired pH 
* pH meter
* Weighing balance 
* Weighing boat 
* Spatula  

**Procedure**

#. Dissolve 157.6 g of Tris-HCl powder in 500 to 700 mL of distilled water. 
#. Stir with a magnetic stirrer until all Tris-HCl powder dissolved. 
#. Adjust stock buffer to desired pH (e.g.: 6.8, 8.5, etc.) with NaOH or HCl.
#. Top up volume to 1 L with distilled water. 
#. Label the bottle. 

    * Label example: :code:`Tris-HCl, pH, name initials, date prepared`

#. Store in 4 C. 

**Note:** Sterilisation is not strictly necessary. If needed, can either vacuum filter or autoclave.
