Tris-HCl stock solution
=======================

* Tris-HCl stock solution, 1 M, pH 8.0
* Tris-HCl MW: 157.6 g/mol 


Requires

* Tris-HCl powder 
* Distilled water/Milli-Q water
* Empty 1 L bottle 
* Vacuum filter cup with 0.22 um filter
* Vacuum pump
* Magnetic stirrer
* 1 M NaOH

*Note:* After some trial and eror, it was found that it takes a large volume of 1 M NaOH to raise the pH to 7.5, 2 M is still reasonable. Can try 3 M NaOH next time.


**Procedure**

#. Dissolve 157.6 g of Tris-HCl powder in 500 to 700 mL of distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Stir with a magnetic stirrer until all Tris-HCl powder dissolved. 
#. Adjust pH to 7.5 with 1 M NaOH.

    Or adjust to any other pH you need, e.g.: 8.0, 8.5, etc.

#. Top up volume to 1 L with distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Filter with vacuum filter cup into a new 1 L bottle. 
#. Label the bottle. 

    Label example: :code:`Tris-HCl pH 7.5, name initials, date prepared`

#. Seal the bottle with parafilm and store in 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C. 


Vacuum filter is a faster way to sterilise the buffer. Based on google search, there are no problem autoclaving Tris-HCl solution.

For whatever reason, you will get extra volume of liquid than the volume of water you put in to dissolve the Tris-HCl. When added 500 mL of water into Tris-HCL, you might ended up getting 600 or 700 mL of liquid. This would affect the final concentration if you added 1000 mL of water into Tris-HCl directly because the final volume will change. Therefore, Tris-HCl was dissolve in smaller amount of water (500 to 700 mL), adjusted pH (solutions used for adjusting pH like HCl and NaOH will add some volume too), then only top up until the final volume is 1 L.
