Miscelleneous 
=============

In our lab, we usually share all the consummables. We don't usually have one set of everything for each student. So be responsible, and refill depleted stuff if it is running low.  

They are certain practices in this lab we think is suitable for safety or aseptic purpose. Although you don't have to strictly follow the practices, it is advisable to follow them. 

Empty bottle
------------
In our lab, we usually prepare autoclaved empty bottle of different volume. This is for filtering use. After we dissolve some substance (e.g.: NaOH, DMEM), we would filter the solution into an autoclaved bottle and seal with parafilm for storage. 

Milli-Q/distilled water in bottle
---------------------------------
We also autoclave Milli-Q water of different volume in bottles and seal with parafilm for storage. This is in case we need to use the water for whatever purpose, such as preparing buffer. 

Microcentrifuge (Eppendorf) tube
--------------------------------
We would fill an empty bottle with microcentrifuge tube, then autoclave the whole bottle. After drying the water in oven, we seal with parafilm for storage. For aseptic purpose, if we wanted to use the microcentrifuge tube, we would open the bottle in biosafety cabinet. We would seal the bottle with parafilm after use before storage.
