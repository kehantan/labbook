Tris-HCl stock solution
=======================

* Tris-HCl stock solution, 1M, pH 7.5
* Tris-HCl MW: 157.6 g/mol 


Requires

* Tris-HCl powder 
* Distilled water/Milli-Q water
* Empty 1 L bottle 
* Vacuum filter cup with 0.22 um filter
* Vacuum pump
* Magnetic stirrer
* 1 M NaOH

*Note: After some trial and eror, it was found that it takes a large volume of 1 M NaOH to raise the pH to 7.5, so can try use 2 M or even 3 M NaOH.*


**Procedure**

#. Dissolve 157.6 g of Tris-HCl powder in 900 mL of distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Stir with a magnetic stirrer until all Tris-HCl powder dissolved. 
#. Adjust pH to 7.5 with 1 M NaOH. 
#. Top up volume to 1 L with distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Filter with vacuum filter cup into a new 1 L bottle. 
#. Label the bottle. 

    Label example: :code:`Tris-HCl pH 7.5, name initials, date prepared`

#. Seal the bottle with parafilm and store in 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C. 

*Vacuum filter is a faster way to sterilise the buffer. Based on google search, there are no problem autoclaving Tris-HCl solution.*
