=========

**Objective:** To prepare 10% SDS. 

* Concentration = 10% SDS w/v, Volume = 10 mL 
  
**Materials**

* SDS powder
* Distilled water 
* Bottle
* Magnetic stirrer
* Weighing balance 
* Spatula 

**Procedure**

#. Weight 1 g of SDS powder into empty bottle. 
#. Add 5 to 7 mL of distilled water into the bottle. 
#. Stir until the solution is clear. 

    * This would take quite some time, about 30 mins for the solution to turn completely clear

#. Top up with distilled water until 10 mL of final volume.
