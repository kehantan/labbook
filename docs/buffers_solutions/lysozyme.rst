Lysozyme stock solution 
=======================

**Objective:** To prepare stock lysozyme solution for protein purification. 

* Final concentration of lysozyme required for 30 mL of lysis buffer is 100 ug/mL, so prepare 10,000 ug/mL stock solution of 1 mL.

**Materials**

* Microcentrifuge tube
* Distilled water 
* Lysozyme powder 

**Procedure**

#. Measure 10 mg (0.01 g) of lysozyme powder in a microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Add 1 mL of distilled water into the microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Mix well, vortex if necessary. 
#. Label and store at 4 C.
