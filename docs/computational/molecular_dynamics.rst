Molecular dynamics
==================

Molecular dynamics (MD) is very much different from molecular docking. The MD engine I am using is GROMACS, there are other MD engine you can use like AMBER or NAMD.   

Visual guide from my `google drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/108psm8MTCf70OTOE96ehjELQ3mR2w1v2?usp=sharing>`_ on how to run MD. 

Workflow
--------
#. Protein/receptor preparation
#. Ligand preparation
#. Define new box and solvation
#. Add ions and water molecules
#. Energy minimisation
#. Equilibration
#. Production
