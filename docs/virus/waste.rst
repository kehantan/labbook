Waste
=====

There are some department policy for waste management that our lab is required to follow because the virus is considered an infectious agent. They may not always make sense, but it is here for documentation purpose. 

* There are specific beaker for virus waste. If you are doing virus related work, use the waste beaker labelled with 'virus'.
* When discarding pipette tips from micropipette into the waste beaker, immerse the tip into clorox first before ejecting the tip. This is to minimise splashing and causing possible contamination.
* Solid waste (pipette tips, culture flask, etc.) from virus related work are required to be discarded into the blue bag under the biosafety cabinet in the lab (not cell culture room).
* Discard liquid waste (clorox) in waste beaker into the designated bottle located under the biosafety cabinet inside the lab (next to the blue bag).
* After discarding the liquid and solid waste in the was beaker, rinse the beaker with tap water. Then left it to air dry in the rack beside the sink.
