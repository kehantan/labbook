MTT stock solution
==================

Concentration we use in this lab, 5 mg/ml. We usually prepare 10 ml in 15 ml centrifuge tube and store in freezer (-20 :math:`\textdegree`\ C).

Requires

* MTT powder 
* Distilled water 
* Centrifuge tube (15 ml)
* Syringe
* Syringe filter (0.22 :math:`\mu m`)

**Procedure**

#. Weight 0.05 g (50 mg) of MTT powder and transfer into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Add 10 ml of distilled water in to the centrifuge tube. 
#. Shake or vortex until dissolve. 
#. Filter with syringe filter. 

    Usually the powder would not dissolve completely, leaving behing some small chunks of precipitate. That is why filter required.
