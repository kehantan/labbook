DMEM
=====

* In this lab, we prepare 1 L of DMEM solution from powder. We then aliquote from 1 L of DMEM to smaller vial (50 mL centrifuge tube) and add FBS, Pen-Strep, and sodium pyruvate to make complete DMEM. 
* Read the packaging or search the data sheet online before preparing DMEM. Because at different times we might order different brands of DMEM powder and different manufacturer would left out different ingredients such as sodium bicarbonate or HEPES. We need to measure the amount of the missing ingredients and manually add them when preparing the media. 
* DMEM can be prepared on bench, but filter in BSC. 

**Requires**

* Autoclaved Milli-Q water (1 L)
* Vacuum filter cup with 0.22 um filter 
* DMEM powder
* Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)
* Magnetic stirrer
* Autoclaved empty bottle (1 L)
* Vacumm pump
* HEPES

**Procedure**

#. Open DMEM powder and pour out whole packet into 1 L autoclaved Milli-Q water.
#. Clean magnetic stirring bar with 70% ethanol then drop into the bottle.
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until DMEM powder completely dissolve in the Milli-Q water.
#. Add sodium bicarbonate into DMEM.  

    * 3.7 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) per litre of DMEM as per instruction stated in `Thermo Fisher Scientific website <https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/12100046?SID=srch-srp-12100046>`_.
    * Refer to their respective website if the DMEM powder is from another manufacturer.

#. Depending on the DMEM powder used, we might need to add HEPES. Refer to manufacturer instructions.

    * Common concentration of HEPES used is 25 mM or 6 g/L of DMEM.

#. Filter DMEM into new 1 L autoclaved empty bottle.

    * Filter DMEM in BSC. 

#. Seal the bottle with parafilm and store in fridge (4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C).
