Before begin cell culture
=========================

Maintain good aseptic technique is important throughout the whole process of cell culture. The biosafety cabinet (BSC) is our main working bench for cell culture work. To reduce possibilities of contamination, adhere to aseptic techniques as much as possible.

Before putting anything into the BSC, we need to spray them with 70% ethanol (including our hands). If you remove your gloved hands from the BSC, touched something else outside the BSC, spray 70% ethanol on your gloved hands before putting it back into the BSC. 

**Common items for cell culture**

* Micropipette
* Micropipette tips
* Serological pipette
* Multichannel pipette 
* Pipette gun
* Waste beaker
* Paper towel
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Microcentrifuge tube
* Culture flask (T25/T75)
* Permanent Marker
* Counting chamber (Neubauer chamber)
* Well plates 
* Tube racks
* Others

This is a non exhaustive list of common items needed for cell culture, it is a good practice to gather the items you need for your procedure before you start your work. 

**Common reagents for cell culture** 

* Media 
* Trypsin 
* Trypan blue
* Phosphate buffer saline (PBS)

This is also a non exhaustive list of common reagents used for cell culture. Reagents like complete DMEM and Trypsin are stored in the fridge, either leave the reagents on the bench or warm them in water bath. Usually it takes 5 to 10 mins to completely warm the reagents. Wipe the reagent container dry if you warm them in water bath, the water from water bath is a very common source of contamination. Trypan blue and PBS are usually stored at the bench, so no warming required.

**Preparation for cell culture work**

About 30 mins before we start the actual cell culture procedure, you will need to do some preparations

#. Gather all the items you need.
#. Carry them to the cell culture room.
#. Lift the window of the BSC to the sash level. Do not lift the window higher than the indicated sash level. 
#. Spray the wall and surface in the BSC with 70% ethanol and wipe with paper towel. 
#. Spray down all the items you need for your experiments with 70% ethanol then place them into the BSC.
#. Close the BSC window.
#. Turn on the UV to sanitise the environment.

Reagents do not need to be UV, instead pre-warm the reagents in 37 C water bath before using. When the reagents are needed, spray the reagent bottles with 70% ethanol then bring them into the BSC. 

**Note**

You might run into certain circumstances where

* You forget to UV some items 

    You can just spray them with 70% ethanol then putting them into the BSC, without UV, but it is best to avoid such practice.  

* You took out your hand from the BSC for 2 seconds, do you need to spray with ethanol before putting it back into the BSC?

    As a general rule, I would advice to spray with ethanol, but its not the end of the world if you find it to tedious to do so. 

* You might have seen different approach of aseptic techniques from different soures like the internet, forum, or you might learn the aseptic techniques from somewhere else. You can adopt them as you see fit. 

*REMEMBER*: This is a general practice/rules/guidelines/protocols that we commonly use in our lab, the goal is to reduce the chances of contamination as much as possible. No one will punish you if you do not follow the rules strictly in exchange for convenience. However, you are advised to adhere to these practice **WHENEVER POSSIBLE**. Whatever you do in the lab, use your own judgement, common sense, and logic. If unsure, don't hesitate to discuss with lab mates or supervisors, or even ask them for help.
