Protein expression
==================

**Objective:** To culture bacteria that will express the target recombinant protein. 

* Protein expression  

**Requires**

* Transformed BL21
* BL21 cell + Plasmid
* :ref:`IPTG stock solution <iptg>`

Section 1 - Preparation
-----------------------

Prepare LB agar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* To prepare LB agar, follow the instructions on the LB agar bottle. 
* This procedure can be carried out on lab bench.

**Requires** 

* LB agar powder 
* Petri dish 
* Schott bottle (500 mL)
* Distilled water 
* Autoclave
* Kanamycin stock solution (30 mg/mL)
* Bunsen burner
* Lighter

**Procedure**

#. In a 500 mL bottle, dissolve LB powder in 250 mL distilled water. 
#. Add 250 uL of Kanamycin stock solution into LB agar solution. Final concentration of Kanamycin = 30 ug/mL
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until powder completely dissolve. 
#. Autoclave.

    * Set the autoclave mode to 'warm' instead or 'normal'. This would keep the agar at 60 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C after autoclave is complete so the agar would not solidifies. 

#. Pour agar into petri dish. 
#. Wrap in plastic bag and store on bench. 

Prepare LB broth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* To prepare LB broth, follow the instructions on the LB broth bottle.
* This procedure can be carry out on lab bench.  

**Requires**

* Erlenmeyer flask (2 L)
* Weighting balance
* Spatula 
* LB broth powder 
* Distilled water 
* Measuring cylinder (1 L)
* Kanamycin stock solution (30 mg/mL)

**Procedure**

#. In a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask, dissolve 12.5 g of LB powder in 500 mL distilled water. Cover the mouth of the flask with aluminium foil. 
#. Autoclave. 120 C, 15 mins. 
#. Wait until the LB broth cools down, then add 500 uL of Kanamycin stock solution into LB broth. 
#. Cover the mouth of the flask with aluminium foil and store on bench. 

**Note:** For the ease of work, aside from preparing a 1 L LB broth for large scale culture, we can also prepare another LB broth in a 500 mL bottle used for various purpose such as small scale culture and as a blank for measuring the OD of the cultured bacteria. 

Subculture E. coli
------------------

**Requires**

* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Transformed *E. coli* cultured on plate 
* Plastic inoculation loop
* Bunsen burner

**Procedure** 

#. Aliquote 2 x 10 mL from 1 L LB broth into seperate 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Aliquote 5 mL of broth into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 

    To be used as blank later. 

#. Pick a single *E. coli* colony from agar plate and mix with LB broth in the 15 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Pick a single *E. coli* colony from agar plate and streak on new LB agar plate. 
#. Shake the centrifuge tube. 24 hrs, 37 :math:`^{\circ} C`, 180 rpm.

Large scale culture
-------------------

**Requires**

* Spectrophotometer
* 2 L Erlenmeyer flask
* 2 L orbital shaker
* :ref:`IPTG stock solution <iptg>`
* Refrigerated centrifuge 

**Procedure**

#. Decant the 2 15 mL centrifuge tube culture into the 1 L LB broth. 
#. Shake. 1 to 3 hrs, 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, 180 rpm. 
#. Check OD at 600 nm. 

    * Previous step mentioned shake for 1 to 3 hours, but check OD every hour to make sure the reading falls around 0.5.
    * Access to spectrophotometer: Faculty of Pharmacy.

#. Add 1 mL IPTG (50 mM) to the 1 L LB broth culture. 
#. Shake. 2 hrs, 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, 180 rpm.
#. Centrifuge. 3000 rpm, 10 mins. 

    * Centrifuge with the chiller centrifuge in Bilik Kultur Tisu 1. Each bucket can only hold 1 50 mL centrifuge tube, therefore need to split the 1 L culture into multiple 50 mL centrifgue tube. 
    * Remember to book the machine before use, and pre-cool at least 20 mins before use 

#. Decant supernatant. 
#. Wash pellet with PBS. 

    * Although there are no problem using PBS for cell culture, it is best to prepare another PBS for bacteria work to reduce possibilities of contamination. 
    * No fixed volume, use adequte anount of PBS.

#. Resuspend pellet in PBS. 
#. Transfer suspension into new 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 
#. Decant supernatant. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube.
#. Store pellet at -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C.

    * Bacterial pellet can be stored in -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C for months wihtout problem. 
    * Wrap the centrifuge tube in plastic bag before storing in -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C to prevent contamination of other samples.
