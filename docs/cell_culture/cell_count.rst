Cell count
==========

To get an estimation of how many cells are there in a given sample. 

Requires
--------

* 15 ml centrifuge tube
* Counting chamber
* Counter
* Trypan blue
* 96 well plate (for mixing trypan blue and the cell suspension)

Procedure
---------

Trypsinise
~~~~~~~~~~
Assume our cells were cultured in a T25 culture flask.

#. Remove DMEM from culture flask.
#. Dispense 600 uL of PBS into culture flask. 

    Swirl the flask, make sure to wash the cells thoroughly

#. Remove PBS. 
#. Dispense 600 uL of TrypLE.

    Swirl the flask, make sure the TrypLE covers all the cells.

#. Incubate the culture flask at 37C for 5 minutes 

    Usually we incubate for 3-5 mins, but don't incubate more than 10 mins

#. Remove the culture flask from incubator.
#. Dispense 600 uL of complete DMEM into the culture flask.

    Swirl the flask to ensure the TrypLE is fully neutralise

#. Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 1500rpm, 5 mins.
#. Remove supernatant with micropipette, but leave minimal amount of liquid in the centrifuge tube.
#. Resuspend the cell pellet by flicking the centrifuge tube. 
#. Resuspend the cells with 1 ml of complete DMEM. Pipette repeatedly to break cell pellet. 


Cell counting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Pipette 10 uL of trypan blue into one well of the 96 well plate.
#. Pipette 10 uL of cell suspension from centrifuge tube to the well that have trypan blue. Mix by repeat pipetting. 
#. Take 10 uL of the trypan blue and cell mixture, and dispense into the counting chamber.
#. Count the cells. 

The formula for calculating number of cells in 1 ml of cell suspension

:math:`\frac{\text{sum of cells from 4 quadrant} \times 10^4 \times 2}{4} = X cells/ml`
