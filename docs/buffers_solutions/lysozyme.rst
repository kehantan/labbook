Lysozyme stock solution 
=======================

**Objective:** To prepare stock lysozyme solution for protein purification. 

* Final concentration of lysozyme required for 30 mL of lysis buffer is 100 ug/mL, so here we prepare 10,000 ug/mL stock solution of 1 mL.
* I recommend preparing fresh lysozyme solution before use, I don't recommend storing unused lysozyme stock solution for future use.
* 

**Requires**

* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 mL)
* Distilled water 
* Lysozyme powder 

**Procedure**

#. 10 mg (0.01 g) of lysozyme powder in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Add 1 mL of distilled water into the microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Mix well, vortex if necessary.
