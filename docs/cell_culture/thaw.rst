#. Transport frozen cell vial in low temperature (portable liquid nitrogen container or dry ice) to cell culture area.
#. Prepare a culture dish with pre-warmed medium.
#. Thaw cells rapidly (e.g., in a 37°C water bath).
#. Note: Thawing cells rapidly ensures high cell viability.
#. Optional step to remove cryopreservant and non-viable cells: resuspend cells in medium and briefly centrifuge (150–300 xg for 3–5 min.). Resuspend cell pellet in fresh medium.
#. Transfer freshly thawed cells into a dish.
