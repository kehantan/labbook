Product (AMC) standard curve
============================

**Objective:** To plot a standard curve for substrate used in protease assay. 

**Materials**

* Tris-HCl stock buffer solution (Tris-HCl, 1M, pH 8.5)
* 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) stock solution (10 mg/mL)
* 384 well black plate
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips  
* Microcentrifuge tube/PCR tube
* Waste beaker 
* DMSO 

**Procedure**

*Prepare working buffer*

#. Add 1 mL of stock buffer solution into 4 mL of distilled water, resulting in 200 mM of Tris-HCl buffer of pH 8.5.

*Prepare AMC stock*

#. Weight 10 mg (0.01 g) into a microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Add 1 mL of DMSO into the microcentrifuge tube. 

*AMC Serial dilution*

#. Prepare 7 microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Add 91.2 uL of working buffer into the first tube. 
#. Add 8.8 uL of AMC stock into the first tube. Mix well using vortex or repeat pipetting. 
#. Transfer 50 uL of mixture from first tube to second tube. Mix well using vortex or repeat pipetting.
#. Transfer 50 uL of mixture from second tube to third tube. Mix well using vortex or repeat pipetting.
#. Repeat the process until last tube.

+--------------------+------+------+------+-------+

*AMC standard curve* 

#. Add 36 uL of Tris-HCl working buffer into 384 well black plate according to number of concentrations of AMC to be tested. 
#. Add 4 uL of each concentration of serial diluted AMC into designated wells. 
#. Read plate at 350 nm for excitation and 440 nm for emission every 10 mins for a duration of 60 mins. 

**Results** 

* Graph can be plotted using GraphPad Prism. 
* The graph plotted should be linear. 
* Use simple linear regression model to fit the line of best fit into the data points.
