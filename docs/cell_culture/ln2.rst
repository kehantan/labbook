Liquid nitrogen (LN2)
=====================

* LN2 are meant for long term storage of cells. For short term storage, you can keep it in -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C.
* There is a LN2 tank in our lab. Remember to check the LN2 level once a week, we prefer to keep the volume of LN2 above 10 cm high.
* When storing cells, rmember to fill in the form which record which tower and which box are your cells being stored at in the form. 
* Remember to check the LN2 tank is properly closed after you take out/store your cells to prevent the LN2 from drying up.
