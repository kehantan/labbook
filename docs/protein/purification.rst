Before begin, prepare the buffers. Preferrably one day before, because adjusting pH of buffers takes quite some time.  


**Lysis buffer**

**Buffer D** 

We would need at least 3 L of buffer D. 

+------------------------------+-------+----------+----------+

+----------+-------------------+-------+----------+----------+
| 300 mM   | NaCL (MW 58.44)   |       | 1.753 g  | 70.12 g  |
+----------+-------------------+-------+----------+----------+
| Top up with water up to              | 100 ml   | 4000 ml  |     
+--------------------------------------+----------+----------+

We store the pellet at -80 C 

Extraction
----------

Requires

* Ice box filled with ice
* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml)
* PCR tube
* Centrifuge tube (15 ml)
* Ni-NTA resin 
* Lysis buffer
* Buffer B
* Buffer C
* Buffer D 
* Rotator

Purification
------------
Protein purification with Ni-NTA resin

**Preparation of Ni-NTA resin**
#. Mix the Ni-NTA solution well before use. 
#. Add 2.5 ml of Ni-NTA resin into 50 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min.
#. Remove supernatant.
#. suspend pellet with 5 ml of Buffer B. 
#. Centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min.
#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Keep the 50 ml centrifuge with Ni-NTA in ice until later use. 


**Protein purification from prepared pellet (after lysis)**

#. Remove supernatant from prepared pellet.

    Take 100-120 :math:`\mu L` of supernatant for SDS-PAGE later (**sample #0**)

#. Add 2-5 ml of Buffer B to the pellet and vortex well. 
#. Adjust the volume to 24 mL with Buffer B. 

    Take 100-120 :math:`\mu L` for SDS-PAGE later (**sample #1**)

#. Cool the sample on ice for 30 mins to 1 hr. 
#. Devide the suspensions into 24 microcentrifuge tubes.
#. Centrifuge at 20,000 - 27,000 g, 4 :math:`\textdegree C`, for 10 mins. 
#. Collect supernatant.
#. To make SDS-PAGE sample, add 1 mL of lysis buffer or Buffer B to pellet and mix well. 

    Keep 120 :math:`\mu L` of suspended pellet and supernatant for SDS-PAGE sample (**sample #2, sample #3**)

#. Add supernatant to Ni-NTA resin

    Store all pellet in their respective microcentrifuge tube at 4 :math:`\textdegree C`

#. Rotate at 4 :math:`\textdegree C` for 30 mins to 1 hr. 

    Bring the rotator into the cold room

#. Centrifuge at 500 g (or 3000 rpm) for 5 mins at 4 :math:`\textdegree C`. 
#. Collect supernatant into new microcentrifuge tube. (**sample #4**)
#. Add 10 mL Buffer B into the Ni-NTA resin. 
#. Centrifuge again at 500 g (or 300 rpm) for 5 mins at 4 :math:`\textdegree C`.
#. Collect supernatant into new microcentrifuge tube. (**sample #5**)

    This is basically a washing process. 

#. Transfer Ni-NTA resin to column using Buffer B. 
#. Collect flow through and keep 120 :math:`\mu L` for SDS-PAGE. 
#. Add 10 mL of Buffer B and collect the elution. Repeat this process for 3 times.   

    Keep 120 :math:`\mu L` of each elution for SDS-PAGE (**sample #6, sample #7**)

#. Add 2 mL of Buffer C and collect the elution. (**sample #8**)
#. Repeat the previous steps for 3 more times. 4 fractions will be collected. (**sample #9, sample #10, sample #11**)
#. Add 2 mL of Buffer C and collect the elution. (**sample 12**)
#. Run SDS-PAGE and stain with CBB for all 12 samples. 

    SDS-PAGE for this uses about 12-15% gel.


SDS-PAGE 
--------


Dialysis
--------
* Dialysis was done with Thermo Fisher Scientific Slide-A-lyzer Dialysis Casssette.
* This procedure needs to be carried out in cold room.
* It is best to pre-cool Buffer D to 4 :math:`\textdegree C`, so bring the buffer into cold room at least 1 hr before starting the procedure. 
* Other equipments needed in the cold room including magnetic stirrer and retort stand. 

**Procedure** 

Select 2-3 fractions containing NS2B/NS3 Protein. Leave 120 uL for SDS-PAGE. 

#. With a syringe and needle, inject the fractions into the cassette. 
#. Submerge the cassette into Buffer D. 
#. Leave the set up in the cold room for 1 hr in the cold room. 
#. After 1 hr, change the buffer. Leave the set up for another 1 hr. 
#. After 1 hr, change the buffer. Leave the set up overnight. 
#. Collect the dialysised solution from cassette into centrifuge tube. 
#. Store the solution at :math:`\textdegree C`. 

    Collect 120 :math:`\mu L` for SDS-PAGE
