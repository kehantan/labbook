Plaque assay results
====================

* Plaque assays should form plaques, which is a small, clear area that surrounded by cells. 
* After stained with crystal violet, the cells surrounding the plaques should be purple in colour. 
* In theory, the lower the virus dilution (virus is less diluted), the more virus particles there is, so more plaques would form; the higher the dilution (virus is more diluted), the less virus particles there are, so less plaques would form. 
* Assuming you are getting plaques and not other problems like cells detaching due to other technical issues, there are several outcomes that you would get from a well in plaque assay:

    * Too many plaques that they overlapped with each other, resulting in large clear area, indicating large amount of cells detached. This means the virus titer is too high for this well.  
    * You get individual plaques, no overlapping. Each plaque is surrounded by non infected cells. However, there are too many plaques, which can be difficult to count. 
    * You get individual plaques, no overlapping. Each plaque is surrounded by non infected cells and there are around 100 plaques in each well. This is the most ideal outcome we want, where there is plaque formation and there are not too many to a point that they are difficult to count. 

* Pick wells that have countable plaques and count the plaques for the wells. 
* Whether a well is consider countable or uncountable is very subjective, choose whichever you are comfortable with. If you do different plates of plaque assay with the same virus sample I would suggest choose at least 3 wells from all the well plates. You could choose more if desired.  

Calculations
------------

* The number we wanted to get here is plaque forming unit per mL (pfu/mL). Count the number of plaques in one of the wells you choosen, and put the number into the formula:

:math:`\frac{\text{Number of plaques}}{\text{Dilution factor} \times \text{Volume of virus sample used, in mL}} = \text{X pfu/mL}`

:math:`\text{Number of plaques}` = The number of the plaques that you counted 

:math:`\text{Dilution factor}` = The dilution factor you used for the virus sample. E.g.: :math:`10^{-6}`, :math:`10^{-7}`, :math:`10^{-8}`, etc. 

:math:`\text{Volume of virus sample used}` = If you follow this protocol, it would be 300 uL, or 0.3 mL. If you use other volume, then use that volume, in mL 

* After you get the pfu/mL for the first well, repeat the process for the nother 2 wells you choosen (assume you choose 3 wells to count). After you get the pfu/mL for all the wells, average them by doing

:math:`\frac{\text{Sum of pfu/mL for well 1, 2, and 3}}{3} = \text{Virus titer}`

* Then this is the final virus titer for that particular batch of your virus stock. 
* Would the same batch of virus stock but from different microcentrifuge tube have different titer? 

    Yes, but since its impractical to do plaque assay for all the microcentrifuge tubes, we would assume the titer we get is same for the whole batch of virus stock. The factor for the fluctuation in virus titer including condition of the cell used, replication speed of the virus, handling techniques, etc. 

* If we make another batch of virus stock from the virus stock which we already know the virus titer, do we still have to do plaque assay to find out the virus titer?

    Yes.
