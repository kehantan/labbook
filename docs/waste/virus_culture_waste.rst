Virus waste
===========

This section is about virus waste, refer to :ref:`cell culture waste <cell culture waste>` section for waste generated from cell culture related work.

There are some department policy for waste management that our lab is required to follow because virus is considered an infectious agent. These rules might not always make sense, but it is here... 

    * for documentation purpose
    * at least you know such rule exists
    * as a respond to auditor

* There are specific beaker for virus waste. If you are doing virus related work, use the waste beaker labelled with related keywords such as *virus* or *for virus use*.
* When discarding pipette tips from micropipette into the waste beaker, immerse the tip into clorox first before ejecting the tip. This is to minimise splashing that can cause potential contamination.
* Solid waste (pipette tips, culture flask, etc.) from virus related work are required to be discarded into the blue bag under the laminar flow cabinet in the lab (not in cell culture room).
* Discard liquid waste (clorox) in waste beaker into the designated bottle located under the laminar flow cabinet inside the lab (next to the blue bag), which has a label, *virus waste*.
* After discarding the liquid and solid waste in the was beaker, rinse the beaker with tap water. Then left it to air dry in the rack beside the sink.
