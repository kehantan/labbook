LB agar plate
=============

* To prepare LB agar, follow the instructions on the LB agar bottle. 
* This procedure can be carried out on lab bench.

**Requires** 

* LB agar powder 
* Petri dish 
* Schott bottle (500 mL)
* Distilled water 
* Autoclave
* Kanamycin stock solution (30 mg/mL)
* Bunsen burner
* Lighter/matchsticks

**Procedure**

#. In a 500 mL bottle, dissolve LB powder in 250 mL distilled water. 
#. Add 250 uL of Kanamycin stock solution into LB agar solution. Final concentration of Kanamycin = 30 ug/mL.
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until powder completely dissolve. 
#. Autoclave.

    * Set the autoclave mode to 'warm' instead or 'normal'. This would keep the agar at 60 C after autoclave is complete so the agar would not solidifies. 

#. Pour agar into petri dish. 
#. Wait until agar plate is cooled down, then wrap in plastic bag and store on bench or in refrigerator.
