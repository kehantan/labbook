Enzyme progress curve
=====================

**Materials** 

* Tris-HCl stock buffer (1M, pH 8.5)
* Purified protease (with known concentrations in ug/mL or uM) 
* MCA substrate stock solution (10 mM)
* DMSO
* 384 well black plate 
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips
* Microcentrifuge tube/PCR tube 

**Procedure**

*Assay buffer*

#. Add 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl stock buffer solution into 4 mL of distilled water to obtain 200 mM of Tris-HCl assay buffer solution at pH 8.5. 

    * Adjust the volume if necessary. The ratio of 1 M Tris-HCl to distilled water needed is 1:4 to make 200 mM Tris-HCl

#. Mix well. Vortex if necessary. 
#. Leave at bench for later use. 

*Protease dilution*

#. Prepare different concentration of enzyme at final volume of 36 uL. 

    * Enzyme concentration: 20, 15, 10, 5 uM 

#. Calculate volume of enzyme stock to be added into each well. 
#. Top up each well with assay buffer until final volume of 36 uL. 

*Substrate dilution*

#. Add 25 uL of substrate stock into 75 uL of assay buffer to a final volume of 200 uL. 
#. 

Optional: Split substrate into smaller volume (10 uL) for each concentration to prevent cross contamination. 

*Protease activity assay*

#. Retrieve the purified protease from -80 C and thaw at room temperature. 
#. Do a 2 fold serial dilution of protease with working buffer. 

    * Final volume of protease in each well = 32 uL/well.
    * Calculate sufficient final volume of serial dilution that is sufficient for at least duplicate, triplicate if possible. 
   
#. In a 384 well black plate, add 32 uL of the serial diluted protease into different wells.
#. In the 'Blank' wells, add 32 uL of assay buffer. 
#. Add 8 uL of 1mM substrate into each well, including the 'Blank' wells. 
#. Read plate at 350 nm excitation and 440 nm emission every 2 mins for total duration of 60 mins.
