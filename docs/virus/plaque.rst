Plaque assay
============
Plaque assay to quantify the virus titer in a sample. 

Dilution of virus 
-----------------
#. Dilute the stock virus from microcentrifuge tube in a 10 fold dilution factor. 
#. Can start from 1 to 5 times dilution factor.

Infection
---------
Infect 6 well plate previously seeded with Vero cells. The cells in the 6 well plate should have around 90% confluency. 

#. Remove media with serological pipette. 

    Aspirate media from wall of the well to prevent scratching on the cell layer

#. Wash with PBS

    There are no fix amount use, just need to cover the cell layer. I usually use 300 uL and dispense from the wall of each well to prevent detaching the cell layer due to pressure from micropipette. 

#. Add 300 uL of 2% DMEM in negative control well.
#. Add 300 uL from microcentrifuge tube with diluted virus to corresponding well. 

    Remember to vortex the mircocentrifuge tube before adding the virus to the well to mix the virus. 

#. Incubate the 6 well plate at 37 C for 1 hour. Tilt the plate every 20 mins. 
#. After 1 hour, overlay the infected cell layer with agarose. 

Agarose overlay
---------------
#. Prepare agarose by heating it in a microwave oven. 
  
    Heat until the agarose melts and boils, but do not let agarose bubble for too long, as it will evaporate the water content in the agarose.

#. In a 15 ml centrifuge tube, add 9 ml of 2% DMEM and 1 ml of agarose. 

    Mix the agarose and 2% DMEM by repeating pipette. 

#. Remove the media from 6 well plate. 
#. Wash the cells 2 times with PBS.
#. Dispense 1.5 ml of agarose mixture into each well. 
#. Leave the 6 well plate in room temperature for 10-15 mins.
#. Agarose should hardens after around 10 mins. Then transfer the 6 well plate into incubator. 

It usually takes 24 hrs for the CPE to form, and another 24 hrs for the cell infected with virus to die. So usually after 48 hrs of incubation, we can stain the plaque assay. 

Staining 
--------
To stain the cells that are attached to the 6 well plate. Dead cells would detached from the 6 well plate and get washed away, leaving behind a clear spot after staining. 

#. Fix the cells with 3.7% PFA for 1 hr.
    
    There are no fix volume, just need to cover the cell layer. I usually use 300 uL. 

    Dispense from the wall of each well. 

#. Remove PFA after 1 hr. 
#. Immerse the plate in a bucket of water for a few times to wash away the agarose. 
#. Decant excess water from 6 well plate by slightly tapping the plate facing down against a paper towel. 
#. Stain the wells with crystal violet for 2-3 mins. 

    No fix volume required, just need to cover the cell layer. I usually use 300 uL. 

    Dispense from the wall of each well. 

#. Tilt the plate to make sure crystal violet covers the whole area in a well. 
#. Remove crystal violet. 
#. Immerse the plate in a bucket of water for a few times to wash away excess crystal violet. 
#. Decant excess water from 6 well plate by slightly tapping the plate facing down against a paper towel. 
#. Leave the plate to dry.
