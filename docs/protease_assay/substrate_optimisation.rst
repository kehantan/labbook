Substrate optimisation
======================

**Objective:** To determine the optimum concentration of substrate to be used in protease inhibition assay

**Materials**

* 384 well black plate
* Substrate (Boc-Gly-Arg-Arg-MCA)
* Stock buffer (1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5)
* Purified protease with known concentrations 
* Distilled water 
* Micropipette and tips 

**Procedure**

*Prepare working buffer solution*

#. Add 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl into 4 mL of distilled water to obtained 200 mM of Tris-HCl working solution at pH 8.5. 

    * Adjust the volume if necessary. The ratio of 1 M Tris-HCl to distilled water needed is 1:4 to make 200 mM Tris-HCl

#. Mix well. Vortex if necessary. 

*Prepare substrate dilution*

        * Concentration of substrate to be tested: 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 0 uM 
        * Fixed volume of 10 uL of substrate would be used.
        * Substrate concentration to be prepared: 1,000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25 uM. Because only 10 uL of the substrate would be added into 90 uL of protease + buffer mixture, this cause the substrate to dilute 10 times in the final volume of 100 uL. 

#. Add calculated amount of working buffer solution into 384 well black plate. 
#. Add fixed amount of protease into 384 well black plate. 

    * According to the Km value obtained from protease activity assay

#. Add 10 uL of diluted substrate into their respective wells. 
#. Read plate at 350 nm excitation and 440 nm emission every 2 mins for a total of 60 mins.
