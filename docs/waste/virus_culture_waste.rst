Virus waste
===========

* When discarding pipette tips from micropipette into the waste beaker, immerse the tip into clorox first before ejecting the tip. This is to minimise splashing that can cause potential contamination.
* Solid waste (pipette tips, culture flask, etc.) from virus related work are required to be discarded into the blue bag under the laminar flow cabinet in the lab (not in cell culture room).
* The solid waste need to be autoclaved before disposal into the yellow bin. 
* Discard liquid waste (clorox) in waste beaker into the designated bottle located under the laminar flow cabinet inside the lab (next to the blue bag), which has a label, *virus waste*.
* After discarding the liquid and solid waste in the was beaker, rinse the beaker with tap water. Then left it to air dry in the rack beside the sink.
