Serial dilution
===============

Assume we have 20 mg of compound X, diluted in 1 mL of DMSO, which makes the concentration of stock solution of compound X 20 mg/mL. We want to prepare the following dilutions from the 20 mg/mL stock solution: 

200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 ug/ml

with each concentration consists of 600 uL of final volume. 

Calculate the volume of stock needed for the first concentration: 

:math:`C_1 \cdot V_1 = C_2 \cdot V_2`. 

:math:`20 mg/ml \times V_1 = 200 ug/ml \times 1,200 uL`

:math:`20,000 ug/ml \times V_1 = 200 ug/ml \times 1,200 uL`

:math:`V_1 = \frac{200 ug/ml \times 1,200 uL}{20,000 ug/ml}`

:math:`V_1 = 12 uL`

First concentration would consists of 12 uL of stock solution of compound X + 1188 uL of media = 1,200 uL of total volume.

#. Prepare 7 microcentrifuge tube. Label the concentrations on the tube. 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 ug/mL.
#. Add 1,188 uL of media into the microcentrifuge tube labelled with '200 ug/mL'. Then add 600 uL of complete DMEM into other microcentrifuge tubes. 
#. Add 12 uL stock solution of compound X into the '200 ug/mL' microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by repeat pipetting or vortexing.
#. Transfer 600 uL of liquid from the '200 ug/mL' microcentrifuge tube to the 100 ug/mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by repeat pipetting or vortexing. 
#. Repeating the steps by transferring 600 uL of mixture from the current microcentrifuge tube to the next microcentrifuge tube and mix well by repeat pipetting or vortexing. 
#. For the last microcentrifuge tube (3.125 ug/ml in this example), discard 600 uL of liquid after mixing. Then we have a complete set of serial diluted compound X.  

There are serial dilution calculator that can be found on the internet, you can use that. I would recommend familiar yourself with serial dilution as this is the standard method for preparing solutions. Also, it saves a little bit of time in terms of calculations and actual preparations.
