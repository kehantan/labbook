Bradford assay
==============

**Objective:** Quantify concentration of protein in a sample.

**Requires**

* Microcentrifuge tube
* Distilled water 
* Bovine serum albumin (BSA)
* Bradford reagent 
* Clear 96 well plate
* Microplate reader 
  
**Procedure**

#. Prepare a series of BSA standard solutions of known concentrations (e.g. 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mg/mL) by diluting a stock solution of BSA in distilled water or buffer.
#. In a clear 96 well plate, add 10 uL of diluted BSA into 190 uL of Bradford reagent. 
#. The reaction mixtures were mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 5 mins.
#. Prepare protein sample, with and without dilution.

    I usually do 1/2 fold serial dilution. 

#. Read absorbance at 595 nm and 490 nm.
