Plaque assay
============

**Objective:** To quantify the virus titer in a virus sample. 

* Vero cells are used in this protocol, seeded in 6 well plate. For plaque assays in 12 well plate or well plate of other sizes, the procedures are the same, just the volume of liquids, number of cells, and volume of reagents used are different. 
* This is just a guideline for plaque assay, adjust the parameters according to literature or should you see fit. 
* Schematics of plaque assay can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12KLdlDftXJ22pbflFmYKli6ztxyudEKHW6V2Ocw5Nhg/edit?usp=sharing>`_

Trypsininse, cell count, seed cells
------------------------------------

* Estimated time required: 1 hrs
* Amount of cells harvested from a T75 flask with 80% confluency should be sufficient to seed at least two 6 well plate with 450,000 cells in each well for next day virus infection.
* Number of cells to be seeded into each well depends on which day you want to do infection. 
 
    * Seed 6 well plate with 450,000 cells per well for next day infection  
    * Seed 12 well plate with 170,000 cells per well for next day infection

**Procedure**

Trypsinise, count, seed 
-----------------------

#. Trypsinise the cells in culture flask. Refer to :ref:`trypsinise <My target>`.
#. Count the number of cells. Refer to :ref:`cell count <cell count>`. 

    * Check if there are enough cells for seeding in a 6 well plate at 450,000 cells/well. 
    * :code:`6 well * 450,000 cells = 2,700,000 cells needed`, so we will need at least :code:`2,700,000 cells` for seeding in a 6 well plate 
    
#. Add 1500 uL of media into each well in the 6 well plate.

    * 1000 uL of media into each well if using 12 well plate 

#. Add correct amount of cells into each well. 
#. Tilt the well plate back and forth and side to side to distribute the cells evenly across the base of the wells. 
#. Incubate, 37 C, 24 hrs. 

Infection
---------

* Estimated time required: 2 hrs 
* Before infection, check the cell confluency in the 6 well plate. The cells should be around 70-80% confluency. 
* For steps involving virus, avoid using serological pipette, as our lab policy requires virus waste to be handled seperately and autoclaved before disposal. Autoclaving and disposing serological pipette can be a bit challenging due to its length.

**Materials**

* :ref:`2% DMEM <2 dmem>`
* Microcentrifuge tube 
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* :ref:`Agarose (5%) <agarose>`
* Virus stock
* :ref:`Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) <pbs>`
* Serological pipette (5 mL, 10 mL)
* Micropipette (1000 uL)
* Micropipette tips 
* Waste beaker 

Virus stock serial dilution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Prepare a 10x serial diultion of virus from the virus stock. Other dilution factor may also be used depending on the situation. 

#. Label 5 microcentrifuge tube for different dilution factors: D1 - :math:`10^{-1}`, D2 - :math:`10^{-2}`, D3 - :math:`10^{-3}`, D4 - :math:`10^{-4}`.
#. Add 450 uL of 2% DMEM into each tube. 
#. Retrieve virus stock from -80 C and thaw virus stock in 37 C water bath. 
#. Add 50 uL of virus stock into D1. Mix well by either pipette repeatedly or using a vortex.
#. Transfer 50 uL of diluted virus from D1 to D2. Mix well by either pipette repeatedly or using a vortex.
#. Transfer 50 uL of diluted virus from D2 to D3. Mix well by either pipette repeatedly or using a vortex.
#. Transfer 50 uL of diluted virus from D3 to D4. Mix well by either pipette repeatedly or using a vortex.

*Note:* Assuming we are infecting Vero cells with virus in 6 well plate, which uses 300 uL of virus containing media, so diluting the virus to final volume of 450 uL is sufficient. If infecting Vero cells in a 12 well plate, which would use only 100 uL of diluted virus, we can reduce the volume to 300 uL so we don't waste the media (e.g.: 30 uL of virus stock + 270 uL fresh 2% DMEM).

Infection
~~~~~~~~~

#. Label each well in 6 well plate.

    +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
    | VC                   | D2 - :math:`10^{-2}` | D4 - :math:`10^{-4}` |
    +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
    | D1 - :math:`10^{-1}` | D3 - :math:`10^{-3}` | NC                   |
    +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

    * NC = Negative control
    * VC = Virus control (undiluted virus sample)

#. Remove existing media from each well with serological pipette. 

    * Aspirate media from the corner of the well to prevent scratching on the cell layer.
    * For this step we can still use serological pipette because the virus is not added into the wells yet. 

#. Wash cells with PBS. 

    * Add 300 uL of PBS into each well from the wall of the wells. 
    * Tilt the plate side to side and back and forth a few times to properly wash the cells, make sure all the cells are covered by PBS. 
    * Remove PBS after washing cells. 
    * There are actually no fixed amount to use, just need enough amount to cover the cell monolayer.
   
#. Add 300 uL of 2% DMEM into NC well.
#. Mix the virus by using a vortex or repeat pipetting. Transfer 300 uL of diluted virus from microcentrifuge tube into their corresponding wells. For VC, add 300 uL of undiluted virus sample into the well. 
#. After all the wells were infected, tilt the plate back and forth and side to side to make sure the virus covers all the cells evenly in the wells. 
#. Incubate, 37 C, 1 hour. Tilt the plate every 20 mins. 
#. Around 15 minutes before the infection period ends, prepare agarose overlay. 

*Note:* Infection uses 300 uL of liquid throughout the procedure, this is assuming the cells were cultured in a 6 well plate. The volume can be reduced to 150 uL if using 12 well plate. Adjust the volume accordingly if any other sizes of well plates were used. 

Agarose overlay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Pre-warm agarose* 

#. Adjust water bath to 60 C.
#. Around 15 mins before the infection period ends, melt the solidified agarose in a microwave oven. 
  
    * **CAUTION!** Loosen the cap of the agarose bottle before microwave, pressure built up can cause explosion! 
    * Heat until the agarose melts and boils, but do not let agarose boils for too long, as it will evaporate the water content in the agarose, changing the agarose concentration. 
    * Heat until the agarose bubbling for 1 or 2 seconds should be sufficient. 
    * Swirl the bottle and check if there are unmelted agarose or solid chunks of agarose in the bottle.
    * **CAUTION!** Handle melted agarose with care, use mittens, boiled agarose is extremely hot! 

#. Leave the boiled agarose in the water bath at 60 C to cool down for later use.

    * If 60 C is not possible, then 37 C can work too, but need to act fast when preparing the overlay. 

*Prepare agarose overlay*

*Note:* Work fast when overlaying the agarose as it can solidify within short period of time. 

#. Bring agarose from water bath into BSC. 
#. In a 50 ml centrifuge tube, prepare an agarose to 2% media mixture of 1:9 ratio (1.2 mL of agarose into 10.8 mL of media). Mix the agarose and 2% DMEM mixture either by repeat pipetting or invert the centrifuge tube few times.
#. Remove virus from the 6 well plate. 

    * Don't use serological pipette for this step, use micropipette. 
    * Use different pipette tips for each well to prevent cross contamination.

#. Wash cells with PBS.

    * Add 300 uL of PBS into each well from the wall of the wells. 
    * Tilt the plate side to side and back and forth a few times to properly wash the cells. 
    * Remove PBS after washing the cells. 
    * Use different micropipette tips for each well to prevent cross contamination. 

#. Add around 1.5 mL of agarose overlay into each well. 

    * Serological pipette can be used for this step. 
    * Add the overlay mixture from the wall of each well.

#. Leave the 6 well plate at room temperature for 5 to 10 mins for the agarose overlay to solidify.

    * Slightly tilt the plate to check if the agarose solidifies. 
    * Do not tilt the plate at an overly steep angle as the agarose will torn apart upon its own weight. 

#. Transfer the 6 well plate into incubator.

    * As long as the agarose overlay is not too fluid, it should be safe to transfer into incubator. 

#. Incubate, 37 C, 2% CO2, 5-7 days. 

*Note1:* 

* 12 mL of agarose overlay mixture is sufficient for a 6 well plate (1.5 mL/well). For 12 well plate, can prepare 13 mL of agarose overlay mixture (1 mL/well). 
* The ratio of agarose to 2% DMEM used in this protocol is 1:9. There are some optimisation required depends on the condition of the agarose. Ratio of agarose to 2% DMEM can be changd to 1.5:8.5 or 2:8. But keep in mind that too much agarose can cause the overlay to be too solid, which will create plaques with very tiny size; whereas too less agarose can cause the overlay to be too fluid, which creates plaques with larger sizes. Either outcome might alter the plaque size too much to a point where the plaques can be difficult to count, which is undesirable.  

*Note2:* When working with virus samples, our lab have specific procedure to dispose the virus related waste. Refer to section :ref:`below <clean_up>`.

Fix and stain 
-------------

* Estimated time required: 1 hr
* Fixing and staining of 6 well plate in laminar flow in the lab. 

**Materials**

* :ref:`Paraformaldehyde (PFA), 3.7% <pfa>`
* Crystal violet
* Micropipette (1000 uL)
* Micropipette tips
* Bucket/large beaker for washing
* Paper towel 
* Waste beaker 

**Procedure**

#. Retrive 6 well plate from incubator and placed inside laminar flow in the lab.
#. Add 300 uL of 3.7% PFA into each well to fix the cells for 20-30 mins. Tilt the plate to make sure PFA covers all the cells. 
    
    * Use the micropipette for bench use.
    * There are no fix volume, just need to cover the cell layer. 300 uL should be enough. 
    * Dispense from the wall of each well. 
    * It is normal for the agarose to torn apart or disintegrate once PFA was applied. 

#. Remove PFA. 

    * Remove PFA from the corner of the well to prevent scratching the cells. 
    
#. Rinse the well plate in a bucket of water for a few times to wash away the agarose overlay. 

    * Fill a bucket with tap water first, then immerse the whole well plate into the bucket for about 1-2 seconds then take out the well plate. Repeate the process for 2 or 3 times.
    * Make sure the agarose is detached. If the agarose did not detached, can turn the plate over with the wells facing downwards and tap on the sink. 
    
#. Decant excess water from 6 well plate by slightly tapping the well plate facing downwards on a paper towel. 
#. Add 300 uL of crystal violet into each well. 

    * No fix volume required, just need to cover the cell layer. 300 uL should be sufficient for a single well. 
    * Tilt the plate to make sure crystal violet covers the all areas within the wells. 

#. Tilt the plate for 3 to 5 mins. 
#. Remove the crystal violet from the edge of the wells.
#. Rinse the plate in a bucket of water for a few times to wash away excess crystal violet. 

    * Same procedure as how to rinse away the agarose overlay as mentioned above.  

#. Decant excess water from the 6 well plate by slightly tapping the plate facing downwards on a paper towel. 
#. Leave the plate on bench to air dry.
