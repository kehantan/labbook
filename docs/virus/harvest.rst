Harvest virus
=============

Harvest virus to make virus stock.  


**Requires**

* Centrifuge tube (15 ml)
* Microcentrifuge tube 


**Procedure**

Assume the culture is in a T25 culture flask. 

#. Label 10 microcentrifuge tube. 

    Label example: :code:`Virus type, passage number, date, name initials`

#. Transfer media that contain dead cells and virus into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 1500 rpm, 5 mins. 
#. Aliquote 500 uL of supernatant into the labelled microcentrifuge tube. 

    In a T25 culture flask with 5 ml of 2% DMEM, it should be enough to aliquote 10 microcentrifuge tube. 
    
    Be careful when aliquote to not disturb the sediments. 

#. Seal the microcentrifuge tube with parafilm. 
#. Snap freeze the microcentrifuge tube by submerge into liquid nitrogen for about a minute. 
#. Store the snap frozen microcentrifuge tube in -80 C. 

The harvested virus stock need to have its virus titer quantified. We do this by using :ref:`plaque assay <plaque assay>`.
