Substrate optimisation
======================

**Objective:** To determine the optimum concentration of substrate to be used in protease inhibition assay

**Requires**

* 96 well plate, black
* Substrate (MCA)
* Stock buffer (1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)
* Purified protease
* Autoclaved Milli-Q water

**Procedure**

    *Prepare working buffer solution*

        Prepare working buffer solution (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) from stock buffer solution (1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)

    *Prepare substrate dilution*

        * We want to test 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 0 uM substrate with fixed concentration of protease. 
        * We want to use fixed volume of 10 uL of substrate.
        * So instead, we make different substrate concentration of 2,000, 1,000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25 uM. Because we wil be adding only 10 uL of the substrate into 90 uL of protease + buffer mixture, this cause the substrate to dilute 10 times in the final volume of 100 uL. 

#. Add calculated amount of working buffer solution into 96 well black plate. 
#. Add fixed amount of protease into 96 well black plate. 
#. Add 10 uL of different concentration of substrate into respective wells. 
#. Incubate for 30 mins at 37 C. 
#. Read plate at 350 nm excitation and 440 nm emission.
#. If the curve does not quite reach plateau incubate another 30 mins and read the plate again.
