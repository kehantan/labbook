MTT results
===========

* The raw reading obtained is the absorbance reading. 
* Most microplate reader allows the results to be easily export to MS Excel file. If not, have to convert them manually into an Excel sheet. 

**Workflow**

#. Average all the reading from the 3 wells of each concentrations (including blank and negative control wells). 
#. Minus off values from blank wells .This is to remove the background noise generated by DMSO (which we used as a blank).
#. Devide absorbance reading of each well by the absorbance reading of non-treated control. 
#. Times the value by 100 to convert to percentage. 

:math:`\text{Inhibition} (%) = \frac{T}{NTC} \times 100\%` 

T = Treated
NTC = Non-treated control 

#. Plot the graph in graphpad prism or any other software to calculate ic50. 


* Under typical condition, non-treated control should have the highest absorbance reading. Followed by reduced absorbance reading as the concentration of compound used to treat the cells going up, due to toxicity of the tested compounds against the cells. However, this will not always be the case.
* Final interpretation of the results depends on experiment design and what to expect from the cytotoxicity results.
