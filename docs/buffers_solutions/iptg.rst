IPTG stock
==========

* This protocol is for preparing 250 mM IPTG stock solution 
* Final volume: 10 mL 
* MW: 238.31 g/mol

**Requires**

* IPTG powder

    IPTG powder is usually stored in fridge (4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C)

* Distilled water
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)

**Procedure**

#. Measure 0.0579 g of IPTG powder into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Dissolve IPTG powder in 5 mL of distilled water. Vortex if necessary. 
#. Add distilled water up to 10 mL of final volume. 
#. Label

    Label example: :code:`IPTG, concentration, name initials, date prepared`

#. Store in freezer (-20 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C)

**Note:**

The concentration of stock solution is depending on what you wanted to use it for. This protocol only shows only 1 concentration, you can prepare stock solution in other concentrations based on your own workflow and requirements.
