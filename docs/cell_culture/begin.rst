Before we begin cell culture
============================

**Some ground rules**

Maintain good aseptic technique is important throughout the whole process of cell culture. 

The biosafety cabinet (BSC) is our main working bench for cell culture work. To reduce possibilities of contamination, adhere to aseptic techniques as much as possible. The regulars including always wear gloves and lab coat. 

Before putting anything into the BSC, we need to spray them with 70% ethanol (including our hands). If you remove your gloved hands from the BSC, touched something else outside the BSC, spray 70% ethanol on your gloved hands before putting it back into the BSC. 

**Common items for cell culture**

* Micropipette (10 to 100 uL and 100 to 1000 uL)
* Micropipette tips
* Serological pipette (5 mL and 10 mL)
* Pipette gun
* Waste beaker
* Paper towel
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Culture flask (T25/T75)
* Permanent Marker
* 96 well plate for mixing trypan blue and cell suspension for cell count

    It doesn't necessarily have to be a 96 well plate. You can use anything that you find useful, some people use microcentrifuge tube, some people use parafilm. This is up to your preference.  

* Counting chamber (Neubauer chamber)

    You can place the whole counting chamber, including its box together into the BSC, or you can just place only the counting chamber in to the BSC. This is up to your preference. 

* Well plates (96, 24, 12, etc.)
* Cell scraper
* Others

These are the common items needed for cell culture, find out which one is required for your procedure before you start your work. 

**Common reagents for cell culture** 

Common reagents we would be using for cell culture including: 

* Complete DMEM 
* TrypLE 
* Trypan blue
* Phosphate buffer saline (PBS)

Reagents like complete DMEM and TrypLE are stored in the fridge, you could either leave the reagents on the bench or warm them in water bath. Usually it takes 5 to 10 mins to completely warm the reagents. Trypan blue and PBS are stored at the bench, so no warming required.

**Preparation for cell culture work**

About 30 mins before we start the actual cell culture procedure, you will need to do some preparations

#. Gather all the items you need into the basket available in the lab.
#. Carry them to the cell culture room.
#. Lift the window of the BSC to the sash level. Do not lift the window higher than the indicated sash level. 
#. Spray the wall and surface in the BSC with 70% ethanol and wipe with paper towel. 
#. Spray all the items you need for your experiments with 70% ethanol before placing them into the BSC.
#. Close the BSC window.
#. Turn on the UV to sanitise the items.

    Turn on UV for about 30 mins. You can reduce the time if you don't want to wait for that long. 

You do not need to UV the reagents, instead pre-warm these reagents in 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C water bath before cell culture. 

We would place the reagents into the BSC only after UV was done. Again, remember to keep good aseptic techniques, spray 70% ethanol on the reagent bottles/containers before placing them into the BSC. 

**Note**

You might run into certain circumstances where

* You forget to UV some items 

    You can just spray them with 70% ethanol then putting them into the BSC, without UV, but it is best to avoid such practice.  

* You took out your hand from the BSC for 2 seconds, do you need to spray with ethanol before putting it back into the BSC?

    As a general rule, I would advice to spray with ethanol, but its not the end of the world if you find it to tedious to do so. 

* You might have seen different approach of aseptic tecniques from different soures like the internet, forum, or you might learn the aseptic techniques from somewhere else. You can adapt them as you see fit. 

*REMEMBER*: This is a general practice/rules/guidelines/protocols that we use in our lab. The goal is to reduce the chances of contamination as much as possible. No one will punish you for not following these practices. However, you are advised to adhere to these practice **WHENEVER POSSIBLE**. Whatever you do in the lab, use your own judgement, common sense, and logic. If unsure, don't hesitate to discuss with lab mates or supervisors.
