Bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA)
==============================

We use kit for this assay. 

This procedure can be carried out on bench. 

Requires

* PCR centrifuge tube 
* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml)
* 96 well plate

**Procedure**

**Prepare BCA reagent solution**

Before we run the experiment, we have to prepare Reagent A:Reagent B:Reagent C in ratio of 25:24:1. Calculate how much reagent needed for your experiments.

**Prepare serial dilution of sample**

#. Prepare and label 8 microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Dispense 60 uL of distilled water into each microcentrifuge tube except the first tube. 
#. Aspirate 120 uL of sample into first microcentrifuge tube. Mix with repeat pipetting.  
#. Trasfer 60 uL of sample + distilled water mixture into second microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Repeat the dilution process from second microcentrifuge tube untill the last tube. 
#. Discard 60 uL of mixture from the last microcentrifuge tube.  

**Prepare different concentration of standard solution**

Prepare different concentration of BCA stanadard (Albumin). 

    25, 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000 ug/ml

To prepare different concentrations of standard solution, dilute the standard solution that included in the kit with distilled water.  

#. Prepare and label 8 microcentrifuge tubes. 
#. Dispense appropriate amount of distilled water into each microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Dispense appropriate amount of standard into each microcentrifuge tube. Mix the standard and distilled water by repeat pipetting. 

**In 96 well plate**

After preparing all the reagent and samples, we need to put everything into the 96 well plate. Remember to prepare blank in one of the well. 

Usually we dispense 50 uL of sample + 50 uL of reagent = 100 uL into each well.

#. Label the 96 well plate. 
#. Dispense 50 uL of each standard solution into different wells.

    For blank, just dispense 50 uL of distilled water into one well. 

#. Dispense 50 uL of reagent solution into each well, including the blank well. 

    While dispensing the reagent solution, repeat pipette to mix the reagent and the standard solution. 

#. Dispense 50 uL of different concentrations of sample into different wells. 
#. Dispense 50 uL of reagent solution into each sample wells. Mix the reagent solution and the sample solution by repeat pipetting. 
#. Incubate for 1 hr at 37 C.
#. Read absorbance at 562 nm. 

*Note: Remember not to have liquids on the lid, or just take off lid when reading. Liquid on lid can lead to deviations.*
