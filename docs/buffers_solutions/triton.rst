Triton X-100 stock
==================

* Dilute to 10% concentration with distilled water
* Can be prepared on bench 
* We would prepare 10 mL of 10% Triton X-100 stock solution

Triton X-100 is a very viscous solution. Our lab usually purchased the commercially available 100% Triton X-100.


**Procedure**

#. Add 9 mL of distilled water into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Add 1 mL of 100% Triton X-100 solution. 
#. Pipette repeatedly to mix Triton X-100 with distilled water. Use a vortex if necessary. 

    Triton X-100 can be a little bit difficult to mix with water at the beginning. Vortex will also cause excessive bubbling. However, the bubbles will disappear after left to stand for some time.
