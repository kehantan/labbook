Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 
=======================

**Objective:** To prepare NaOH solution at 5 M concentration.  

* Est. preparation time = 15 mins
* Concentration = 5 M, Volume = 100 mL
* NaOH MW = 39.997 g/mol

**Materials**

* NaOH pellet
* 1 L empty bottle
* Disitlled water
* Magnetic stirrer
* Weighing boat
* Weighing balance
* Spatula  

**Procedure**

#. Measure 20 g of NaOH pellet into about 50-70 mL of distilled water. 
#. Stir with a magnetic stirrer until NaOH pellet completely dissolved. 
#. Top up the NaOH solution with distilled water up to 100 mL of final volume. 
#. Label the bottle. 

    * Label example: :code:`NaOH, 5M, name initials, date prepared`

#. Store at bench.
