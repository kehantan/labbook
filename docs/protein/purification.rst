Protein extraction and purification
===================================

**Objective:** To extract and purify expressed protein from bacteria. 

Protein purification is quite a long procedure where multiple samples will be collected for further testing. All the samples (I mean **ALL**, both supernatant and precipitate) will be stored until the target protein was obtained. Therefore, it is important to clearly label every tubes/containers used. 

**Requires**

* Ice box filled with ice
* Microcentrifuge tube (1.5 mL)
* PCR tube
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL and 50 mL)
* Ni-NTA resin 
* Lysis buffer
* Buffer B
* Buffer C
* Buffer D 
* Rotator

Buffers 
-------

Before we begin, we need to prepare the buffers needed for this process, preferrably at least one day before use, because even though we are preparing from stock solution, weighing and stirring can take up significant amount time. Also, buffer D need to be pre-cooled in the cold room. 

**Lysis buffer**

In this protocol, we need at least 25 mL of lysis buffer, so prepare around 30 mL should be sufficient for 1 round of purification.

**Buffer B**

It's not strictly necessary, but it is best to prepare 2 buffer B: one for bench use, another to pre-cooled in cold room.

**Buffer C**

Buffer C need to be pre-cooled in cold room, we only use Buffer C in cold room.

The bacterial pellet from the end of :ref:`expression <protein-expression>` procedure was stored at -80 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C. Extraction and purification would proceed from there.  

Protein extraction
------------------

#. From the bacterial pellet from 500 mL culture. 
#. Add 5 mL of lysis buffer into each centrifuge tube and suspend the pellet completely. Use a vortex if necessary. 

    * It is normal for the suspension to become slimy when lysis buffer was added.

#. Combine the suspension of both tube into a single 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Leave the centrifuge tube at room temperature for 30 mins.

    * Optional: Rotate the centrifuge tube at 60 rpm with a rotator. 
    * Can :ref:`prepare Ni-NTA resin <resin_prep>` while waiting for the incubation. 

#. Prepare for sample homogenisation. Refer to :ref:`section below <homogenisation_prep>` for preparation of homogenisation procedure.
#. Pour suspension into small plastic beaker. Place the plastic beaker into ice. 
#. Homogenise the sample using sonicator. 

    * Sonicator settings in mol med: output 10-20, duty cycle 70%, 2 sec on, 0.5 sec off, for 1-2 mins, on ice.   
    * Sonicator settings in FOP: Amp 35% (The max amp for the probe is 40%), 2 sec on, 0.5 sec off, for 1-2 mins, on ice. 
    * It is difficult to say what is the optimum settings for the sonicator. The general rule is that the suspension should froth after sonication. However, there can be cases where the suspension does not froth at all after 8 mins of sonication, while another suspension froth seconds after the sonification starts, both suspension from the same batch of sample, using same settings, same container, same condition and all. 
    * Some optimisation could be done like amount of suspension to sonicate each time. I had tried 20 mL, 10 mL, 8 mL. I find that using smaller volume, the suspension froth more easily, so perhaps it works better by splitting one batch into smaller portion for each sonication, like using 8 mL or 5 mL for each sonication.  

#. Transfer the homogenised suspension into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 8000 rpm, 4 C, 15 mins.  

.. _homogenisation_prep:

**Preparation for homogenisation**

* Fill a bucket with ice (get ice from ice machine).  
* Look for a small plastic beaker which is 10 mL or 20 mL in volume under the 'glassware' cabinet. 
* Use plastic beaker because the sonic pulse generated by homogeniser might break glass beaker. 
* Pour the suspension in the plastic beaker and submerge the beaker in ice bucket until silghtly below the lip of the beaker to maintain the suspension at 4 C throughout the sonication process.
* Because we added 25 mL of lysis buffer into the pellet and the small plastic beaker cannot contain all 25 mL of liquid at once, we can seperate the suspension into two portion and homogeinise seperately.

Protein purification
--------------------

.. _resin_prep:

**Preparation of Ni-NTA resin**

#. Mix the Ni-NTA solution well before use. 

    * Ni-NTA would form a thick gel-like layer at the bottom of the container. Invert the container multiple times to resuspend the gel-like substance completely into the solution. 

#. Add 2.5 mL of Ni-NTA resin into 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 500 x g (or 3,000 rpm), 5 mins.
#. Remove supernatant.

    * The precipitate can easily resuspend into the solution with the slightest movement, so remove slowly, steadily and with care. 

#. Resuspend pellet with 5 mL of Buffer B. 
#. Centrifuge. 500 x g (or 3,000 rpm), 5 min.
#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Keep the 50 mL centrifuge with Ni-NTA in ice until later use. 

**Protein purification from pellet (after lysis)**

#. Remove supernatant from the centrifuged tube.

    * Collect 100 uL of supernatant for SDS-PAGE later (**sample #0**)

#. Add 2 to 5 mL of Buffer B to the pellet and vortex to completely dissolve the pellet. 
#. Add Buffer B into the tube up to 24 mL of volume. 

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE later (**sample #1**)

#. Cool the sample on ice for 30 mins to 1 hr. 
#. Devide the suspensions into 24 microcentrifuge tubes (1 mL per microcentrifuge tube).
#. Centrifuge. 20,000 to 27,000 x g (or 15,000 rpm), 4 C, 10 mins. 
#. Collect supernatant.

    * Collect 100 uL of the collected supernatant for SDS-PAGE (**sample #2**)

#. Collect pellet. 

    * To make SDS-PAGE sample of pellet, add 1 mL of lysis buffer or Buffer B to pellet and mix using vortex. 
    * Leave the pellet on ice for 1 hr, then collect 100 uL of suspended pellet for SDS-PAGE (**sample #3**)

#. Add the collected supernatant to Ni-NTA resin

    * Store all pellet in their respective microcentrifuge tube at 4 C

#. Rotate. 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, 30 mins to 1 hr. 

    * Bring the rotator into the cold room

#. Centrifuge. 500 x g (or 3000 rpm), 4 C, 5 mins. 
#. Remove supernatant.
    
    * Collect 100 uL of supernatant for SDS-PAGE (**sample #4**)

#. Add 10 mL Buffer B into the Ni-NTA resin and mix well. 
#. Centrifuge. 500 x g (or 3,000 rpm), 4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C, 5 mins.
#. Remove supernatant. 

    * Collect 100 uL of supernatant for SDS-PAGE (**sample #5**)

#. Transfer Ni-NTA resin to column using 10 mL of Buffer B. 
#. Collect flow through. 

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE (**sample #6**) 

#. Add 10 mL of Buffer B and collect the elution. 

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE (**sample #7**)

#. Add 2 mL of Buffer C and collect the elution. 

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE (**sample #8**)

#. Repeat the previous steps for 4 more times. A total of 4 fractions will be collected. 

    * Collect 100 uL for SDS-PAGE (**sample #9-#12**)

#. Run SDS-PAGE for all 12 samples. Refer to :ref:`SDS-PAGE <sds-page>` for the protocol. 

Dialysis
--------

* Dialysis was done with Thermo Fisher Scientific Slide-A-lyzer Dialysis Cassette.
* This procedure needs to be carried out in cold room.
* Pre-cool Buffer D to 4 C, bring the buffer into cold room at least 30 mins before starting the procedure. 
* Other equipments needed in the cold room including magnetic stirrer and retort stand. 
* Select 2 to 3 fractions containing the target protein based on the result from SDS-PAGE.  

**Procedure** 

#. Submerge the cassette in to Buffer D for 10 to 15 mins. 
#. Remove the cassette from the buffer. 
#. Using a syringe and needle, aspirate the fractions selected and inject into the cassette. 
#. Submerge the cassette into Buffer D. 
#. Leave the set up in the cold room for 1 hr. 
#. After 1 hr, change to fresh buffer D. Leave the set up for another 1 hr. 
#. After 1 hr, change to fresh buffer D. Leave the set up overnight. 
#. Collect the dialysised solution from cassette into multiple microcentrifuge tube. 

    * I usually put 0.5 mL into each microcentrifuge tube. 

#. Store the purified protein suspension at -80 C.
