Protein expression
==================

Requires
--------
* Transformed BL21
* BL21 cell + Plasmid

Procedure
---------

Prepare LB agar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Follow the instructions on the LB agar bottle.

#. Dissolve powder in 250 ml distilled water. 
#. Dispense 25 uL of Kanamycin stock solution into LB agar solution.
#. Stir with magnetic stirrer until powder completely dissolve. 
#. Autoclave.
#. Pour agar into petri dish. 

Prepare LB broth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Follow the instructions on the LB broth bottle.

#. Dissolve powder in 1 L distilled water, in Erlenmeyer flask. 
#. Dispense 1 ml of Kanamycin stock solution (300 mg/ml) into LB broth. 
#. Cover flask with aluminium foil and tighten with rubber band. 

    Autoclaved LB broth can be stored on bench for next day use. 

    To reduce risk of contamination, can use 2 L bottle. 

Subculture *E. coli* 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requires 

* 15 ml centrifuge tube 
* Transformed *E. coli* cultured on plate 
* Plastic inoculation loop
* Bunsen burner

#. Aliquote 2 x 10 ml from 1 L LB broth into seperate 15 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Aliquote 5 ml of broth into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. 

    To be used as blank for later experiments.

#. Pick a single *E. coli* colony from agar plate and mix with LB broth in the 15 ml centrifuge tube.
#. Pick a single *E. coli* colony from agar plate and streak on new LB agar plate. 
#. Shake the centrifuge tube. 24 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm.

Large scale culture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Decant the 2 15 ml centrifuge tube culture into the 1 L LB broth. 
#. Shake. 1-3 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm. 
#. Check OD at 600 nm. 

    Previous step mentioned shake for 1-3 hours, but check OD every hour to make sure the reading falls around 0.5. 

#. Add 1ml IPTG to the 1 L LB broth culture. 
#. Shake. 2 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm.
#. Centrifuge. 3000rpm, 10 mins. 

    Centrifuge with the chiller centrifuge in Bilik Kultur Tisu 2. Each bucket can hold 50 ml centrifuge tube. 

#. Decant supernatant. 
#. Wash pellet with PBS. 
#. Transfer suspension into 50 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 
#. Decant supernatant. 
#. Store pellet at -80 C.
