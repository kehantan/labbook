Antiviral assay
===============

Antiviral assay is just a modified plaque assay. Before you do antiviral assay, you should do a regular plaque assay to quantify the virus titer of your virus stock. This is because we need to fix the multiplicity of infection (MOI) to a number, i.e.: MOI of 1, means each cell will have 1 virus particle infected, MOI of 2 will have 2 virus particle infecting 1 cell, etc. 

Before starting antiviral assay, you should have several information ready.

#. Virus titer of your virus stock, in pfu/ml

    This information can be obtain from a regular plaque assay. That is why we need to do a regular plaque assay before doing antiviral assay. 

#. MOI you wanted to use

    To make things easy, we usually just use MOI=1. You can also refer to published articles for the MOI they use. 

#. Concentration of compound you wanted to test

    This requires some trial and error. You can start with 1, 5, 10 mg/mL. 

Cells should be at 70% confluency at the day of infection and treatment.
