Protein expression
==================

* Dengue virus NS2B/NS3 serine protease expression and purification protocol modified from :cite:`yusof_purified_2000,leung_activity_2001`.
* Visual guide `here <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gH0-5dTp8_Dy9wXiwBY4g0EoyiHlWtTPcg7z4TwViss/edit?usp=sharing>`_. 

**Workflow**

#. Agar plate culture
#. Small scale culture 
#. Large scale culture

Agar plate culture
------------------

* Estimated time required: 1 hr

**Materials** 

* :ref:`LB agar plate <lb-agar-plate>` (recommend to prepare at least 1 day before experiment)
* Transformed bacteria glycerol stock (*E.coli*, BL21 strain)
* Inoculating loop 
* Lighter
* Bunsen burner

**Procedure**

#. Sterilise workbench with 70% ethanol and setup work bench for bacteria culture.  
#. Sterilise inoculating loop by passing the loop 2-3 times through the bunsen burner flame. 
#. Take a loop full of the *E.coli* glycerol stock and streak on agar plate. 
#. Incubate. 24 hrs, 37 C.   

Small scale culture
-------------------

* Estimated time required: 1 hr

**Materials**

* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
* Overnight culture of transformed *E. coli* on LB agar plate 
* Plastic inoculation loop
* Bunsen burner
* Lighter 
* :ref:`Small volume LB broth <lb broth small>` (Autoclaved, Kanamycin added (30-50 ug/mL), recommend to prepare at least 1 day before experiment)
* Incubator shaker 

**Procedure** 
 
#. Add 5 mL of LB broth into each 15 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Pick a single *E. coli* colony from agar plate and mix with LB broth in the 15 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Loosen the cap of the tube and shake the centrifuge tube in an incubator shaker, overnight, 37 C, 180 rpm.

Large scale culture
-------------------

* Estimated time required: 8 hrs 

**Materials**

* Spectrophotometer
* :ref:`Large volume LB broth (500 mL) <lb broth large>` (Autoclaved, Kanamycind added (30-50 ug/mL), recommend to prepare at least 1 day before experiment)
* Incubator shaker (2L)
* :ref:`IPTG stock solution (250 mM) <iptg>`
* Refrigerated centrifuge 
* PBS 
* Centrifuge tube (50 mL)
* Dropper 
* Cuvette 

**Procedure**

#. Add the small scale culture from 15 mL centrifuge tube culture into the 500 mL LB broth in the 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. 
#. Shake, 1 to 3 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm. 
#. Check OD at 600 nm every 1 hour using a cuvette and spectrophtometer, target OD ~0.5-0.6. Extend the shaking time if target OD is not reached.

    * Collect ~3 mL of culture sample to measure the OD. Use autoclaved LB broth that is not used for culture as blank.  

#. When OD is around 0.5 - 0.6, add 1 mL of IPTG stock solution (250 mM) to the LB broth culture. 

    * IPTG final concentration in culture = 0.5 mM. 

#. Shake. 2 hrs, 37 C, 180 rpm.
#. Transfer culture from flask into multiple 50 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge, 4000 rpm, 4 C, 10 mins. 

    * Pre-cool the centrifuge to 4 C is preferrable, if not, room temp is fine. 

#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Resuspend pellet in 2 mL PBS.  

    * Prepare another PBS for bacteria work. Seperate bacteria work PBS with cell culture PBS to prevent contamination. 

#. Combine all resuspended pellet into two 50 mL centrifuge tube.
#. Top up PBS to 50 mL in each tube.  
#. Centrifuge, 4000 rpm, 4C, 10 mins.  
#. Remove supernatant. 
#. Label the centrifuge tube.
#. Store pellet at -80 C.

    * Bacterial pellet can be stored in -80 C for months without problem.
