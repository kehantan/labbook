NaOH stock solution 
===================

* NaOH stock solution, 1 M
* NaOH MW: 39.997 g/mol
* This is mainly used for adjusting pH of Tris-HCl. 
* This protocol is for 1 L stock solution, adjust the composition accordingly if you are preparing smaller volume.


Requires

* NaOH pellet
* 1 L empty bottle
* Disitlled water
* Magnetic stirrer 


**Procedure**

#. Measure 40 g of NaOH pellet into 1 L of distilled water. 
#. Stir until NaOH pellet completely dissolved. 
#. Label the bottle. 

    Label example: :code:`NaOH 1M, name initials, date prepared`

#. Seal with parafilm and store in fridge (4 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C). 


*Note: After some trial and errors, it was found that the volume of NaOH required to adjust Tris-HCl to the desired pH is too large. So, with the same procedure, prepare higher M of NaOH solution, perhaps 2 M or 3 M should be more suitable.*
