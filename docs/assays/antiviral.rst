Antiviral assay
===============

Antiviral assay is a modified plaque assay. :footcite:t:`lani2016antiviral,florez2022vitro`

Before we do antiviral assay, we should do a regular plaque assay to quantify the virus titer of the virus stock. This is because we need to fix the multiplicity of infection (MOI) to a number, i.e.: MOI of 1, means each cell will have 1 virus particle infected, MOI of 2 will have 2 virus particle infecting 1 cell, etc. 

Before starting antiviral assay, we should have several information ready.

#. Virus titer of the virus stock, in pfu/ml

    This information can be obtain from a regular plaque assay. That is why we need to do a regular plaque assay before doing antiviral assay. 

#. MOI you wanted to use

    To make things easy, we usually just use MOI=1. We can also refer to published articles for the MOI they use. 

#. Concentration of compound we wanted to test

    This requires some trial and error. I usually start with smaller value like 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ug/mL. 


Cell seeding
------------

For antiviral assay, our cells should be at 70% confluency at the day of infection and treatment. 

For 6 well plate, we can seed 450,000 cells for next day infection and treatment. 

For 12 well plate, we can seed 100,000 cells for next day infection and treatment. 


Infection and treatment
-----------------------

Before the actual infection and treatment, we should prepare few things: 

#. Different concentrations of the compound we wanted to test. 
#. Dilution of virus stock to the concentration we wanted to work with. 

**Different concentrations of compound we wanted to test**

We usually dilute the compounds we wanted to test to the desired concentrations with 2% DMEM. The final volume of the compound we prepare should be 1500 uL. This volume was inteded to be used with 6 well plate, we can be reduce the volume accordingly if we are using well plates of other sizes.   

**Dilution of virus stock to the concentration we wanted to work with**

We need to know the pfu/mL of the virus stock and determine the MOI we wanted to use in order for this to work. We usually to 10 times dilution with 2% DMEM. 

**Procedure**

#. Remove existing media from well plate. 
#. Wash cells with PBS. 
#. Add correct amount of diluted virus stock to designated wells. 
#. Add corerct amount of diluted compound into designated wells.
#. Incubate. 37C, 1 hr. 
#. Wash cells with PBS. 
#. Add the remaining amount of compound-containing media into the disignated wells. 
#. Incubate. 37C, 48 hr. 

Harvest
-------

Observe the well plate every 24 hrs for formation of CPE. Usually the media in the well plates can be harvested after 48 hours. 

I would suggest distribute the media in each well into multiple microcentrifuge tube so we can do multiple plaque assays later on. 

**Procedure**

#. Label the microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Aliquot the existing media in the well plates into
