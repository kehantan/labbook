Protein expression
==================

We use transformed *E.coli* that was plated on agar. Now we need to subculture to new plate and LB broth.

Requires
--------
* Transformed *E.coli*
* Petri dish
* Kanamycin (stock, 300 mg/ml @ 10 ml)
* IPTG (stock, 0.5 M = 1.1915 mg/ml @ 10 ml)

Methods
-------
Day 1
~~~~~
#. Prepare 250 ml LB agar.

    Calculate based on recipe on the bottle. 

#. Prepare 1 L LB broth. 

    Calculate based on recipe on the bottle. 

#. Autoclave both LB agar and broth. 

    LB agar would solidify after autoclave, best to time it so the agar is poured within short period of time after autoclave (before it solidifies). 

#. Dispense 25 uL Kanamycin stock into 250 ml LB agar.
#. Dispense 1 ml Kanamycin stock into 1 L of LB broth. 
#. Pour LB agar into petri dish. 
    
    Agar plates can be store in room temperature. Wrap the agar plates in plastic bag, tape it.

#. Aliquote 10 ml from the 1 L LB broth into two 15 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Take a loop of *E.coli* from the transformed plate, mix with the LB broth in centrifuge tube. 
#. From the 15 ml centrifuge tube, take one loop with a nother plastic loop and streak on agar plate to make *E.coli* stock. 
#. Incubate agar plate and the LB broth in centrifuge tube at 37C for 24 hours. 
  
    Incubate in the incubator in microbe culture room in new block.
    The incubation is to make sure there are no contamination of other bacteria. 

#. The 1 L LB broth can be kept at bench at room temperature. 

    It is best to prepare the broth in 1 L bottle instead of Erlenmeyer flask. If culture in Erlenmeyer flask, close with aluminium foil, and tighten with rubber band. 

Day 2
~~~~~
#. Aliquote 5 ml from the 1 L LB broth into a 15 ml centrifuge tube.
    
    This would be our reference/blank for spectrometer later.

#. Dispense all 10 ml of cultured LB broth from both centrifuge tube into the 1 L LB broth. 
#. Shake in shaker at 37C, 180 rpm for 1-3 hours. 
#. Check the OD of the 1 L broth at 600 nm. 

    Use spectrometer in Bilik alat 1 with a taller cuvette, short cuvette will stuck and cannot be taken out. The absorbance reading should be around 0.5. Monitor closely, don't let the OD go too high. 

#. Add 1 ml of IPTG stock into the 1 L LB broth. 
#. Shake at 37C, 180 rpm, for about 2 hours. 
#. Centrifuge. 
#. Collect pellet
