Triton X-100 stock
==================

* Our lab usually purchased the commercially available 100% Triton X-100. Dilute to 10% concentration with distilled water.
* Can be prepared on bench 
* This protocol prepare 10 mL of 10% Triton X-100 stock solution

**Requires**

* Triton X-100 (100%)
* Distilled water
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)

**Procedure**

#. Add 5 mL of distilled water into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Add 1 mL of 100% Triton X-100 solution. 
#. Pipette repeatedly to mix Triton X-100 with distilled water. Use a vortex if necessary. 

    Triton X-100 is very viscous and can be a little bit difficult to mix with water at the beginning. Vortex will also cause excessive bubbling. However, the bubbles will disappear after left to stand for some time. 

#. Top up with distilled water until final volume is 10 mL.
