Paraformaldehyde (PFA)
======================

* To make 3.7% PFA from 37% PFA
* Mainly used to fix plaque assay


Requires

* 37% PFA
* Distilled water/Milli-Q water
* Empty bottle (Autoclave not needed)


We would use :math:`C_1 \cdot V_1 = C_2 \cdot V_2` to calculate the volume needed to take from 37% PFA to make 3.7% PFA. Assume we wanted to prepare 250 mL of 3.7% PFA from 37% PFA, we would need 25 mL of 37% PFA. 

This preparation do not need to be sterile, so we can prepare it on the bench.


**Procedure**

#. Aliquote 25 mL of 37% PFA into an empty bottle. 
#. Top up to 250 mL with distilled water/Milli-Q water. 
#. Label the bottle. 

    Label example: :code:`3.7% PFA, name initials, date prepared`

#. PFA can be stored in room temperature. 

    In the lab, we store it under the biosafety cabinet.
