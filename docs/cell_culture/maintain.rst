Standard passaging (subculture) 
===============================

Vero cells. Adherent cells. 

* Maintained at P20-P30
* 37C
* 5% CO2 

Requires
--------
* Complete DMEM
* Culturing flask (T25/T75)
* Centrifuge tube 

Procedure
---------
#. Remove medium.
#. Wash cells with calcium- and magnesium-free balanced salt solution, phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
#. Add appropriate amount of detaching agent, TrypLE. 
   * Depends on the flask size, usually I would use 600 uL for T25 flask and 1000 uL for T75 flask. Just need to make sure TrypLE is sufficeint to cover the surface of the flask.
#. Incubate at 37Â°C until cells are fully detached from the dish 
   * usually we do <5 min, not more than 10 min. 
#. Neutralising the TrypLE with complete DMEM by pipetting complete DMEM into the culturing flask.
   * If trypsinise with 600 uL of TrypLE, then insert 600 uL of complete DMEM
#. Transfer the cell suspension from culturing flask to centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge for 5 mins, at 1500 rpm. 
#. Dispose the supernatant with micropipette. 
#. Resuspend the cell pellet (sediment) in fresh complete DMEM, pipette thoroughly to break the cell pellet.
   * For optimal number of cells to ease the counting work, I would usually resuspend cells obtained from T25 flask in 1 ml of complete DMEM; while resuspend cells obtained from T75 flask in 3 ml of complete DMEM. 
   * Sometimes there could be a lot of cells (e.g.: >90% confluency), which I would add more complete DMEM. For example, resuspend cell pellets obtained from T25 in 2 ml of complete DMEM 
#. Count the cells.
#. Place appropriate amount of complete DMEM into culturing flask.
   * T25 = 5 ml 
   * T75 = 9 ml
#. Plate cells onto a new flask at the desired cell density.

Numbers of cells to seed in flask
---------------------------------
T25, to 80% confluency in...
* Next day = 800,000 cells
* 3 days = 500,000 cells
* Next week = 25,000 cells

T75, to 80% confluency in...
* Next day = 1,000,000 cells 
* 3 days = 500,000 cells
* Next week = 50,000 cells
