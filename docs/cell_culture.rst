Cell culture
============

Here contains protocols for different cell culture related procedures.

Refer `here <https://www.healthcare.nikon.com/en/ss/cell-image-lab/knowledge/process.html>`_ for the work cycle of cell culture. 

A typical process of cell culture including following steps:

   #. Trypsinise
   #. Cell count
   #. Cell seeding
   #. Further procedures (subculture, MTT, plaque assay, etc.)

Trypsinisation is a common procedure. Whether we wanted to subculture or conduct any other assays, we would have to trypsinise the cells from culture flask first, then only we proceed with other steps.  


**Before we start any procedure...**

Maintain good aseptic technique is important throughout the whole process of cell culture. 

The usual prep for using the biosafety cabinet (BSC) is: 

#. Sanitise the surfaces inside the BSC with 70% ethanol
#. Spray the items with 70% ethanol and place items into the BSC

   The common items for cell culture including:

      * Micropipette (10 to 100 uL and 100 to 1000 uL)
      * Micropipette tips
      * Serological pipette (5 mL and 10 mL)
      * Pipette gun
      * Waste beaker
      * Paper towel
      * Centrifuge tube (15 mL)
      * Culture flask (T25/T75)
      * Permanent Marker

#. turn on UV for about 15-30 mins. You can reduce the time if you don't want to wait for that long. 


Common reagents we would be using for cell culture including: 

* Complete DMEM 
* TrypLE 

You do not need to UV the solutions, but it is best to pre-warm these solutions in 37 :math:`^{\circ}`\ C water bath before cell culture. Usually it takes 5 to 10 mins to completely warm the solutions. 

Another common reagent we would be using for cell culture is phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Since we usually store PBS at bench/room temperature, we do not need to pre-warm them. 

We would place the reagents into the BSC only after UV was done, before we want to start any procedures. Remember to keep good aseptic techniques, spray 70% ethanol on the solution bottles before placing them into the BSC.
