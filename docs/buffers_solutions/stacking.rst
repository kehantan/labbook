Stacking buffer
===============

**Objective:** To prepare Tris-HCl buffer for casting stacking gel.

* Concentration = 0.5 M, Volume = 100 mL, pH = 6.8
* Tris-HCl MW = 157.6 g/mol

**Materials** 

* Tris-HCl 
* Distilled water 
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips 
* HCl
* Magnetic stirrer
* Bottle
* Spatula 
* Weighing boat  

**Procedure** 

#. Add 7.88 g of Tris-HCl into 50-70 mL of distilled water. 

    * 1 M = 157.6 g/L; 0.5 M = 78.8 g/L = 7.88 g/100 mL

#. Stir untill Tris-HCl powder completely dissolved. 
#. Adjust pH to 6.8 with HCl.
#. Top up with distilled water untill 100 mL. 
#. Label and store at 4 C.
