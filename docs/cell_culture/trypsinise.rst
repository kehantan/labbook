.. _My target:

Trypsinise
==========

**Objective:** To detach adherent cells from the culture flask. 

**Requires**

* TrypLE 
* :ref:`Complete DMEM <10 dmem>`
* :ref:`PBS (1x) <pbs>`
* Centrifuge tube (15 mL)

**Procedure**

Check the cells under microscope before procedure to confirm the cell is at desired confluency. 

#. Remove existing media from culture flask with serological pipette. 
#. Dispense PBS into culture flask. 

    There are no fix volume, main purpose is to rinse the cells and remove DMEM from the cells.
        
    For T25 flask I usually use around 500 uL, while for T75 flask I usually use around 1 ml

#. Remove PBS.
#. Dispense TrypLE.

    There are no fix volume, main purpose is to detach the cells from the culture flask. Dispense enough volume to cover all the cells. 
    
    For T25 flask I usually use around 600 uL, while for T75 flask I usually use around 1 mL

#. Incubate the culture flask for about 3 to 5 mins, but don't incubate for more than 10 mins. 
#. Remove culture flask from incubator. Tap the culture flask to mechanically detach the cells from the flask. 
#. Observe the culture flask under microscope. 

    This step is to observe how much cells have detached. 

    Ideally, the cells should be round in shape and flowing around, indicating the cells were sucessfully trypsinised and detached from the culture flask. You can shake the flask lightly to observe the movement of the cells. 

    Sometimes you will see the cells are round in shape, but did not detach. Before proceeed into next step, there are some steps you can try to salvage more of the cells including: 

        * incubate the flask for another few mins; or  
        * add more TrypLE, then incubate for another few mins 

#. Dispense complete DMEM in amount which is equal to the amount of TrypLE used, to neutralise TrypLE. 

    For example, if we dispense 1 mL of TrypLe, then now we dispense 1 mL of complete DMEM

#. Swirl the flask collect all detach cells. 

    Optional: you can use serological pipette to aspirate some media and flush the base of culture flask to detach the cells. 

#. Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 1,500 rpm, 5 mins. 
#. Remove supernatant, but leave minimal amount of liquid in the centrifuge tube. 

    Usually I would use a micropipette. You can also use serological pipette, but be more cautious as the pipette gun has stronger suction, which might suck out the cell pellet. 

#. Flick or tap the centrifuge tube to break the cell pellet. 
#. Dispense 1 mL fresh complete DMEM to resuspend the cell pellet. Pipette repeatedly to break the cell pellet. 
#. The cell suspension can now be used for further processing or experiments. 

**Cells not detach properly**

It is normal that the cells cannot be harvest completely, there are always some cells that cannot detach from the flask no matter what you do. Unless there are large number of cells that do not detach after the trypsinise step, you can ignore those cells. If cells do not detach properly after trypsinising, some of the things you can do including

* Wash the cells few more times to completely remove FBS. 
* As mentioned above, incubate for a longer period of time or add more TrypLE before prolong the incubation period.
