Triton X-100
============

**Objective:** To prepare Triton X-100 solution. 

* Concentration = 10%, Volume = 10 mL

**Materials**

* Triton X-100 (100%)
* Distilled water
* Centrifuge tube
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips 
* Waste beaker 

**Procedure**

#. Add 5 mL of distilled water into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. 
#. Add 1 mL of 100% Triton X-100 solution. 
#. Pipette repeatedly to mix Triton X-100 with distilled water. Use a vortex if necessary. 

    * Triton X-100 is very viscous and can be a little bit difficult to mix with water at the beginning. Vortex will also cause excessive bubbling. However, the bubbles will disappear after left to sit on bench for some time. 

#. Top up with distilled water until final volume is 10 mL.
