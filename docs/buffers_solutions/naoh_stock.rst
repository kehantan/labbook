NaOH stock solution 
===================

**Objective:** To prepare NaOH stock solution.  

* To make NaOH stock solution at concentration of 5 M.
* NaOH MW: 39.997 g/mol
* This is mainly used for adjusting pH of Tris-HCl. 
* This protocol is for 500 mL stock solution, adjust the composition accordingly if you are preparing smaller volume, or if wanted to prepare higher molar.

**Requires**

* NaOH pellet
* 1 L empty bottle
* Disitlled water
* Magnetic stirrer 

**Procedure**

#. Measure 100 g of NaOH pellet into about 300 mL of distilled water. 
#. Stir with a magnetic stirrer until NaOH pellet completely dissolved. 
#. Top up the NaOH solution with distilled water up to 500 mL of final volume. 
#. Label the bottle. 

    Label example: :code:`NaOH 1M, name initials, date prepared`

#. Seal with parafilm and store at bench. 

    *Optional:* Autoclave
