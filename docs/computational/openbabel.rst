Open Babel
==========
Open Babel is a handy tool for computational chemistry which have multiple functions. Some of the functions that I regularly used including:
* convert between different file formats (e.g.: from .pdb to .mol)
* generate 3D coordinates with option `--gen3d`
* energy minimise a molecule

Installation
------------
Open Babel is mainly a terminal tool, which you run in the terminal. There are GUI interface, but I am not familiar with it. 
There are multiple ways to install Open babel:

#. From repository 
    By typing `sudo apt install openbabel` into the terminal

#. From Anaconda
    By typing `conda install -c conda-forge openbabel` into the terminal 

Note: If you want to use Open Babel on windows, I would suggest installing it via Anaconda.
