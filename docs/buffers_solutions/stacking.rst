Stacking buffer
===============

**Objective:** To prepare Tris-HCl buffer for casting stacking gel.

* Concentration = 0.5 M, Volume = 100 mL, pH = 6.8
* Tris MW = 121.14 g/mol

**Materials** 

* Tris base  
* Distilled water 
* Micropipette 
* Micropipette tips 
* Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 6 N)
* Magnetic stirrer
* Bottle
* Spatula 
* Weighing boat
* Weighing balance 
* Waste beaker 
* pH meter  

**Procedure** 

#. Add 6.05 g of Tris base into 50-70 mL of distilled water. 

    * 1 M = 121.14 g/L; 0.5 M = 60.57 g/L = 6.05 g/100 mL

#. Stir untill Tris base powder completely dissolved. 
#. Adjust pH to 6.8 with 5 N HCl.
#. Top up with distilled water untill 100 mL. 
#. Label and store at 4 C.
