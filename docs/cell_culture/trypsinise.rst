Trypsinise
==========

Trypsinise is a procedure to remove adherent cells from the culture flask

Requires

* TrypLE 
* Complete DMEM
* PBS (1x)
* 15 ml centrifuge tube

*Reminder: Before starting the procedures, warm up medium and TrypLE in 37 C water bath. You can also put your apparatus in the biosafety cabinet and UV them first.*  

**Procedure**

Check the cells under microscope before procedure to confirm the cell is at desired confluency. 

#. Remove media from culture flask. 
#. Dispense PBS into culture flask. 

    There are no fix volume, main purpose is to rinse the cells and remove DMEM from the cells.

    For T25 flask I usually use around 600 uL, while for T75 flask I usually use around 1 ml

#. Remove PBS
#. Dispense TrypLE

    There are no fix volume, main purpose is to detach the cells from the culture flask. Dispense enough volume to cover all the cells. 

    For T25 flask I usually use around 600 uL, while for T75 flask I usually use around 1 ml

#. Incubate the culture flask for about 3-5 mins, but don't incubate > 10 mins. 
#. Remove culture flask from incubator. Slightly tap the culture flask to mechanically detach the cells from the flask. 
#. Dispense complete DMEM in amount which is equal to the amount of TrypLE used, to neutralise TrypLE. 

    For example, if we dispense 1 ml of TrypLe, then now we dispense 1 ml of complete DMEM

#. Swirl the flask collect all detach cells. 

    Optionally you can use serological pipette to aspirate some media and flush the base of culture flask to detach the cells. 

#. Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. 
#. Centrifuge. 1,500 rpm, 5 mins. 
#. Remove supernatant, but leave minimal amount of liquid in the centrifuge tube. 

    Usually I would use a micropipette. You can also use serological pipette, but be more cautious as the pipette gun has stronger suction, which might suck out the cell pellet. 

#. Flick or tap the centrifuge tube to break the cell pellet. 
#. Dispense 1 ml fresh complete DMEM to resuspend the cell pellet. Pipette repeatedly to break the cell pellet. 
#. The cell suspension can now be used for further processing or experiments.
