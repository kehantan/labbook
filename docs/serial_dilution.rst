Serial dilution
===============

To prepare a mixture solution of different concentrations, we can do it two ways: 1) Serial dilution, 2) Prepare each individual concentration seperately.

Assume we have 100 mg of compound X and we wanted to prepare it in the following concentrations:

200 ug/ml, 100 ug/ml, 50 ug/ml, 25 ug/ml, 12.5 ug/ml, 6.25 ug/ml, 3.125 ug/ml

with each concentration consists of 500 uL of liquid. 

The common practice is to prepare a stock solution where we dissolve the solid compound in our preferred solvent (e.g.: distilled water, DMSO, etc.). For this example, we can dissolve 1 mg of compound X in 1 ml of water, to make a 1 mg/ml stock solution. From the 1 mg/ml stock solution, we can further dilute it into the concentrations we want to test. 

Prepare seperately
------------------
Prepare it seperately means we would calculate the amount of stock solutions we need individually with :math:`C_1 \cdot V_1 = C_2 \cdot V_2`. 

:math:`1 mg/ml \times V_1 = 200 ug/ml \times 500 uL`

:math:`1000 ug/ml \times V_1 = 200 ug/ml \times 500 uL`

:math:`V_1 = \frac{200 ug/ml \times 500 uL}{1000 ug/ml}`

:math:`V_1 = 100 uL`

Our 1st concentration would be consists of 100 uL of compound X + 400 uL of solvent (in this example we would just use distilled water) = 500 uL of mixture.

So calculate this again for all the other concentrations. Then we can start pipette into different centrifuge tube. 

Serial dilution
---------------
#. Prepare 7 microcentrifuge tube. Label the concentrations on the tube. 
#. Pipette 800 uL of distilled water into the 200 ug/ml microcentrifuge tube. Then pipette 500 uL of distilled water into other microcentrifuge tube. 
#. Pipette 200 uL stock solution of compound X into the 200 ug/ml microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by repeat pipetting.
#. Transfer 500 uL of liquid from 200 ug/ml microcentrifuge tube to the 100 ug/ml microcentrifuge tube. Mix well by repeat pipetting. 
#. Repeating the steps by pipetting 500 uL liquid to next microcentrifuge tube and mix well. 
#. For the last microcentrifuge tube (3.125 ug/ml in this example), discard 500 uL of liquid after mixing. 
#. Then we have the serial dilution.
